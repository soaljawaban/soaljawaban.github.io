                                            We could fly so high 
Let our spirits never die 
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers 
Create a world with no fear 
Together we cry happy tears 
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares 
We could really get there 
If you cared enough for the living 
Make a little space
To make a better place 
Heal the world Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
From: Heal the World made popular by Michael Jackson
According to the song, why should we make the world a better place?</a>

                                            We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching but you're too shy to say it
Inside we both know what's been going on

Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you

                                            Read the lyrics of the Heal the World and answer the following questions:Heal the WorldThere's a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there's no need to cry. In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow.There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.If you want to know why, there's a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.Heal the world.</a>

                                            Heal the World
There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.

                                            Heal the World
There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.

                                            Belief
John Mayer
Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls
Ever breaking record off
For something someone yelled real loud one time?
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon
For the war that's raging on inside
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrender with their life on the line?
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts a folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can.</a>

Together we cry happy tears 
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares 
We could really get there 
If you cared enough for the living 
Make a little space
To make a better place 
Heal the world Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
And the entire human race 
There are people dying 
If you care enough for the living 
Make it a better place 
For you and for me 
From: Heal the World made popular by Michael Jackson
According to the song, why should we make the world a better place?</h2><br />
                        <p>According to the song "Heal the World" by Michael Jackson, we should make the world a better place because there are people dying and we should care enough for the living. The song emphasizes the need to create a world with no fear, where we can all live together as brothers and turn our weapons into tools for progress. The lyrics encourage us to work together to create a better world, with happy tears and no more sorrow. The message is that we can make a difference if we care enough and work together to heal the world.</p><br />

There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.

                            34. Heal the World
There’s a place in your heart, and I know that it is love. And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow. And if you really try, you will find there’s no need to cry. In this place you’ll feel there’s no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there. If you care enough for the living, make a little space, make a better place. Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why, there’s a love that cannot lie. Love is strong. It only cares for joyful giving. If we try, we shall see. In this bliss we cannot feel fear or dread. We stop existing and we start living.
Then it feels that always love is enough for us growing. So make a better world. Make a better world.
Heal the world. Make it a better place for you and for me and the entire human race. There are people dying. If you care enough for the living, make a better place for you and for me.

                            35. Belief
John Mayer
Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls
Ever breaking record off
For something someone yelled real loud one time?
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon
For the war that's raging on inside
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrender with their life on the line?
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
We're never gonna win the world
We're never gonna stop the war
We're never gonna beat this
If belief is what we're fighting for
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts a folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can.</h2><br />
