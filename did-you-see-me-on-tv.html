                                            I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes, I love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, like this one.        It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me of something.  I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me to edit some photos from the last vacation.  I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?  While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.”  “Where did you get it?” I asked him.  He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked.  I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But, don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now. Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.” “Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.     Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I love him. tentukan orientation , beberapa series of events , personal comment</a>

                                            January 27, 2013 I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes, I love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, like this one. It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me to edit some photos from the last vacation. I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy? While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But, don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now. Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.” “Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I love him. Answer the following questions briefly. 1. When did the story happen? 2. Where did it happen? 3. What was Didi doing at that time? 4. What was he looking for? 5.

Two percent of errors were life-threatening.Hospitals involved in the study were already taking steps to prevent medication mistakes in addition to the extra pharmacist intervention, said Dr. Sunil Kripalani, the study's lead author from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee."We surprised to see that in spite of these efforts that 50 percent (of patients) were still having these medication errors," he told Reuters Health.Although the pharmacist visits didn't help the average patient, he added, certain ones seemed to benefit - such as patients who were on multiple drugs or had trouble understanding health information.As for traditionally lower-risk patients, he said other strategies to prevent errors may be needed.1.

January 27, 2015
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened it, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiah in it.
I tried to recall when I spent my money during the past week, I just remembered that I went to a shopping mall with my cousin, but we didn’t spend much money that day. I thought there must be enough money left on the wallet.
While I was busy thinking, suddenly my cousin, Toto, stepped out with two ice cream cones in his hands.
“Hi, want an ice cream? It’s on me”. He said. “Sure, it’s very kind of you” I answer quickly. While having the ice cream, I said to him “It’s strange that you treat me an ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I found some money in my wallet”. Oh, really? How did you get it?” I asked him. He replied “I don’t know, it was just suddenly there”. “What? Let me see your wallet! I shouted. Then I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. “That’s mine” I told him. “Look… there’s my ID card in it”. We have the same colour of wallet, remember?”
“Sorry man! I didn’t realize that it wasn’t mine”. He said. “but no worries, I didn’t buy anything with that, just those ice cream. “Well, that’s OK” I replied. “Thank you for being so honest, you can keep fifty thousand rupiah with you”, and he thanked me.
Well, I hate his being careless, but fortunately he’s honest. Perhaps that’s why I always love my cousin.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one.       
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something.  I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
 I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.”  “Where did you get it?” I asked him.  He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked.  I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.    
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him.

                                            January 27, 2013
I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one.       
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something.  I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
 I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.”  “Where did you get it?” I asked him.  He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked.  I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.    
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him.

After arriving near the shop, she was surprised to see the Budi stood motionless on the roadside. “Why are you so long?” asked her mother. “I cannot cross this street mom” she was wonder and asked “why does it so? The street was very quiet, right? “”That is right, I want to cross the street but there is no car which passing by” Budi replied. “How can be like that?” her mother getting surprised. “You told me that don’t cross the street before the car pass first and now I am waiting for the car to pass first.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one. 
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. 
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him. </a>

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one.
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him.

                            5. I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes, I love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, like this one.        It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me of something.  I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me to edit some photos from the last vacation.  I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?  While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.”  “Where did you get it?” I asked him.  He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked.  I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But, don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now. Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.” “Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.     Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I love him. tentukan orientation , beberapa series of events , personal comment</h2><br />
                        Saya memiliki perasaan campur aduk tentang sepupu saya. Ya, aku mencintainya, tapi sering kali dia membuatku kesal, seperti ini. Saat itu Senin siang waktu itu. Saya sedang menikmati acara TV ketika saya mendengar bel dari penjual es krim dari kejauhan. Itu mengingatkan saya pada sesuatu. Saya melompat dari kursi saya dan mengambil dompet saya. Saya membuka dompet saya, dan saya terkejut. Hanya ada beberapa rupiah di dalamnya. Seminggu yang lalu, bibi saya memberi saya lebih dari cukup untuk apa yang saya lakukan untuknya. Saya pandai komputer sehingga dia meminta saya mengedit beberapa foto dari liburan terakhir. Saya mencoba mengingat di mana saya menghabiskan uang saya selama seminggu terakhir. Saya ingat pergi ke Jatim Park bersama sepupuku, membeli dua tiket, dua mangkuk sup bakso, dan dua gelas es teh lemon. Itu saja. Apa lagi yang saya beli? Sementara saya sibuk berpikir, sepupu saya melangkah keluar dari pintu depan dan memanggil si es krim. Dia menatap saya dan berkata, “Hei, mau ambil es krim? Itu ada pada saya. ”Dan saya berkata pada diri sendiri,“ Yah itu gratis, jadi mengapa tidak? ”Kami berdua memilih es krim kami dan menikmatinya saat kami bersantai di ruang tamu. Saya bertanya kepadanya "Aneh bahwa Anda benar-benar memperlakukan saya dengan es krim". Dia mengangkat bahunya dan berkata, “Itu karena saya mendapatkan sejumlah uang di dompet saya.” “Di mana Anda mendapatkannya?” Saya bertanya kepadanya. Dia menjawab, “Tidak tahu, kawan. Tiba-tiba saja ada di sana. "" Apa? Biarkan aku melihat dompetmu! ”Teriakku. Kemudian, saya membukanya dan mengetahui bahwa dompet itu milik saya. Saya baru ingat bahwa kami memiliki dompet yang sama dan mereka bahkan memiliki warna yang sama. "Ini milikku," kataku padanya. "Tidak mungkin! Anda yakin? "Tanyanya. Saya menunjukkan kepadanya sebuah kartu dari dompet dan berkata, “Lihat, ini kartu pelajar saya. Beberapa saat yang lalu saya berpikir mengapa uang saya habis. "" Maaf, kawan. Saya tidak tahu bahwa itu bukan milik saya. Tapi, jangan khawatir saya belum membeli apa pun dengan itu. Hanya es krim ini, ”Dia menjelaskan dengan tampang polos. Saya mengambil dompet saya dan berkata, "Tidak apa-apa. Saya minta maaf Anda tidak punya uang tunai sekarang. Di sini, ambil 20 ribu dan beli es krim lagi dengannya. Oh, dan ini dompet Anda. "" Keren! Terima kasih, Bung! ”Jawabnya. Ya, aku benci dia ceroboh. Untungnya, dia jujur. Yah, mungkin itu sebabnya aku mencintainya.<br /><br /><br />....! <br />

Two percent of errors were life-threatening.Hospitals involved in the study were already taking steps to prevent medication mistakes in addition to the extra pharmacist intervention, said Dr. Sunil Kripalani, the study's lead author from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee."We surprised to see that in spite of these efforts that 50 percent (of patients) were still having these medication errors," he told Reuters Health.Although the pharmacist visits didn't help the average patient, he added, certain ones seemed to benefit - such as patients who were on multiple drugs or had trouble understanding health information.As for traditionally lower-risk patients, he said other strategies to prevent errors may be needed.1.

January 27, 2015
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened it, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiah in it.
I tried to recall when I spent my money during the past week, I just remembered that I went to a shopping mall with my cousin, but we didn’t spend much money that day. I thought there must be enough money left on the wallet.
While I was busy thinking, suddenly my cousin, Toto, stepped out with two ice cream cones in his hands.
“Hi, want an ice cream? It’s on me”. He said. “Sure, it’s very kind of you” I answer quickly. While having the ice cream, I said to him “It’s strange that you treat me an ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I found some money in my wallet”. Oh, really? How did you get it?” I asked him. He replied “I don’t know, it was just suddenly there”. “What? Let me see your wallet! I shouted. Then I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. “That’s mine” I told him. “Look… there’s my ID card in it”. We have the same colour of wallet, remember?”
“Sorry man! I didn’t realize that it wasn’t mine”. He said. “but no worries, I didn’t buy anything with that, just those ice cream. “Well, that’s OK” I replied. “Thank you for being so honest, you can keep fifty thousand rupiah with you”, and he thanked me.
Well, I hate his being careless, but fortunately he’s honest. Perhaps that’s why I always love my cousin.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one.       
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something.  I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
 I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.”  “Where did you get it?” I asked him.  He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked.  I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.    
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him.

innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.    
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him.

One day there was a mother cooking in the kitchen.

You have to be careful. Do not cross the street before the car passes first, “her mother warned.”Alright mom” replied Budi.
Budi immediately went to the shop. After waiting for a long time, his mother was worried because Budi did not come after nearly a half an hour. Soon afterward, she left her house to see Budi. She was worried that Budi was in danger.
After arriving near the shop, she was surprised to see the Budi stood motionless on the roadside. “Why are you so long?” asked her mother. “I cannot cross this street mom” she was wonder and asked “why does it so? The street was very quiet, right? “”That is right, I want to cross the street but there is no car which passing by” Budi replied. “How can be like that?” her mother getting surprised. “You told me that don’t cross the street before the car pass first and now I am waiting for the car to pass first. Therefore I cannot cross this street “replied Budi. His mother could only be silent.        Tolong bantu tentukan generic structure nya . makasih :) </h2><br />

                            22. January 27, 2013  I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes, I love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, like this one. It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me to edit some photos from the last vacation. I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy? While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But, don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now. Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.” “Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I love him.</h2><br />
                        27 Januari 2013 saya memiliki perasaan campur aduk tentang sepupu saya. Ya, aku mencintainya, tapi ia bersikap ceroboh kali membuat saya kesal, seperti yang satu ini. Itu Senin<br /> sore pada waktu itu. Aku sedang menikmati acara TV ketika saya mendengar bel dari vendor es krim dari kejauhan. Itu mengingatkan saya tentang sesuatu. Aku melompat dari tempat duduk dan meraih dompet saya. Aku membuka dompet saya, dan saya terkejut. Ada hanya beberapa rupiah di dalamnya. Baru seminggu yang lalu, bibi saya memberi saya lebih dari cukup untuk apa yang saya lakukan untuknya. Saya baik di depan komputer jadi dia meminta saya untuk mengedit beberapa foto dari liburan terakhir. Saya mencoba mengingat di mana saya menghabiskan uang saya selama seminggu terakhir. Aku ingat akan Jatim Park dengan sepupu saya, membeli dua tiket, dua mangkuk sup bakso, dan dua gelas es teh lemon.Itu semua. Apa lagi yang saya beli? Sementara aku sibuk berpikir, sepupu saya melangkah keluar dari pintu depan dan disebut pria es krim. Dia menatapku dan berkata, "Hei, mau ambil beberapa es krim? Ini pada saya. "Dan aku berkata kepada diriku sendiri," Yah itu gratis, jadi mengapa tidak? "Kami berdua memilih es krim dan menikmatinya sementara kita bersantai di ruang tamu. Aku bertanya "Ini adalah aneh bahwa Anda benar-benar memperlakukan saya es krim". Dia mengangkat bahunya dan berkata "Itu karena aku punya beberapa uang dalam dompet saya." "Dari mana kau mendapatkannya?" Saya bertanya kepadanya. Dia menjawab, "Tidak tahu, manusia. Itu hanya tiba-tiba ada. "" Apa? Biarkan aku melihat dompet Anda! "Aku berteriak. Kemudian, aku membukanya dan belajar bahwa dompet itu milikku.Aku baru ingat bahwa kami memiliki dompet yang sama dan mereka bahkan memiliki warna yang sama. "Ini adalah milikku," kataku. "Tidak mungkin! Apakah Anda yakin? "Tanyanya. Aku menunjukkan padanya kartu dari dompet dan berkata, "Lihat, ini adalah kartu ID mahasiswa saya.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one. 
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. 
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him. </h2><br />

It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But, don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now. Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.” “Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I love him.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one.
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I

Saat itu Senin siang waktu itu. Saya menikmati acara TV saat mendengar bel penjual es krim dari kejauhan. Itu mengingatkan saya pada sesuatu. Aku melompat dari kursiku dan meraih dompetku. Aku membuka dompetku, dan aku terkejut. Hanya ada beberapa rupiah di dalamnya. Seminggu yang lalu, bibi saya memberi saya lebih dari cukup untuk apa yang saya lakukan untuknya. Saya ahli di bidang komputer jadi dia meminta saya untuk mengedit beberapa foto dari liburan terakhir. Saya mencoba mengingat di mana saya menghabiskan uang saya selama seminggu terakhir. Saya ingat pergi ke Jatim Park bersama sepupu saya, membeli dua tiket, dua mangkuk sup bakso, dan dua gelas teh lemon es. Itu saja. Apa lagi yang saya beli? Sementara saya sibuk berpikir, sepupu saya melangkah keluar dari pintu depan dan memanggil si es krim. Dia menatapku dan berkata, "Hei, mau ambil es krim? Ini ada pada saya. "Dan saya berkata kepada diri saya sendiri," Baiklah, ini gratis, jadi mengapa tidak? "Kami berdua memetik es krim kami dan menikmatinya saat kami sedang bersantai di ruang tamu. Saya bertanya kepadanya "Aneh bahwa Anda benar-benar memperlakukan saya es krim". Dia mengangkat bahunya dan berkata "Itu karena saya mendapat sejumlah uang di dompet saya." "Dari mana Anda mendapatkannya?" Saya bertanya kepadanya. Dia menjawab, "Tidak tahu, Bung. Tiba-tiba saja tiba di sana. "" Apa? Biarkan aku melihat dompetmu! "Teriakku. Lalu, saya membukanya dan mengetahui bahwa dompet itu milik saya. Saya baru ingat bahwa kami memiliki dompet yang sama dan mereka memiliki warna yang sama. "Ini milikku," kataku padanya. "Tidak mungkin! Apakah kamu yakin? "Tanyanya. Saya menunjukkan kartu dari dompet itu dan berkata, "Lihat, ini kartu identitas murid saya. Beberapa waktu yang lalu saya berpikir mengapa uang saya habis. "" Maaf, Bung. Aku tidak tahu itu bukan milikku. Tapi, jangan khawatir saya belum membeli apapun dengan itu. Hanya es krim ini, "jelasnya dengan tatapan polos. Saya mengambil dompet saya dan berkata, "Tidak apa-apa. Maaf, Anda tidak punya uang tunai sekarang.
