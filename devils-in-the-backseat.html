                                            Mickey is only 12-year-old, but he has finished high school and is currently studying robotic engineering in MIT. He has been working hard on his project to create a mind-controlled exoskeleton that enables the user to move around by 'ordering' the exoskeleton to do so. He believes his invention will be very helpful to mankind, especially to disabled people who have lost their body motor control. He is very determined to develop this machine and hopes that those poor people will be using the machine in the near future and thus be able to have a better life. He has set a strict project plan and aims to finish it within 2 months time. He projects that the control center helmet will have been ready for use by the end of this month and hopefully people will have been using the machine by New Year.His quick progress is not of unfounded reason. When he was 5 years old, he lost his use of legs after he had been severely injured in a motor accident. He was accompanying his mother in the backseat of her car when a truck lost control and hit the car from the rear. Her mother regretted the accident very much, saying he would have been safe and sound at home if she hadn't decided to bring him along. Being a single parent, she had been raising Mike alone.It was certainly a difficult time for the mother and son.cari lah unsur subjek serta predikat dari cerita di atas dan tuliskan kalimat nya ​</a>

He is very determined to develop this machine and hopes that those poor people will be using the machine in the near future (5.......... ...) and thus be able to have a better life. He has set a strict project plan and aims to finish it within 2 months time. He projects that the control center helmet will have been ready for use by the end of this month (6....... ...), and hopefully people will have been using the machine by New Year (present future perfect continuous tense). His quick progress is not of unfounded reason. When he was 5 years old, he lost his use of legs (7.......... ..) after he had been severely injured in a motor accident (8....... He was accompanying his mother (9............. .......) in the backseat of her car when a truck lost control and hit the car from the rear.

Being a single parent, he had been raising Peter alone (past perfect continuous tense) It was certainly a difficult time for the mother and son. Execution Instruction! 1. Read the text above! 2.

                                            Based on the text "Victoria falls", identify the passive sentences found in the text!Victoria FallsVictoria Falls constitutes one of the most spectacular natural wonders of the world. The local people call it "Mosi-oa-Tunya" which means the smoke that thunders. It is located in southern Africa on the Zambezi River at the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.The Victoria Falls is 1.708 meters wide, making it the largest curtain of water in the world. It drops between 90 m and 107 m into the Zambezi Gorge and an average of 550,000 cubic meters of water plummet over the edge every minute.David Livingstone who was the first European to cross Africa from south to north discovered this awe-inspiring waterfall in 1855. He was fascinated by the beauty of the falls. In 1857 Livingstone wrote that no one in England can even imagine the beauty of this scene. The statue of David Livingstone was erected at the Victoria Falls in Livingstone in November 2005. It features a full body replica of Dr Livingstone standing with his right holding his journal and his left hand raised to his forehead as he look upon the water falls. The falls and the surrounding area have been declared national parks and a World Heritage Site, thus preserving the area from excessive commercialization One special vantage point is across the Knife-edge Bridge, where visitors can have the finest view of the Eastern Cataract and the Main Falls as well as the Boiling Pot, where the river turns and heads down the Batoka Gorge. Other vantage points include the Falls Bridge, Devils Pool and the Lookout Tree, both of which command panoramic views across the Main Falls.Today one of the Victoria Falls Bridge's main attractions are historical guided tours focusing on the construction of the bridge, and which include a walking tour under the main deck. On the Zambian side, there is a small museum about the Bridge which is free to enter and has a cafe selling refreshments.Livingstone Island was opened in 1992 to provide exclusive and unique picnics on the edge of the Victoria Falls. It is a protected area that is only allowed a maximum of 16 people on at any one time. The utmost care is taken to protect and preserve the natural habitat of the area. There is also a railway museum in Livingstone, with several old steam trains, and is a good source of information for railway enthusiasts. The Livingstone Island tour is seasonal and can only be done when the water level of the Zambezi River is low enough to allow safe access to Livingstone Island. This is from approximately late June to early March.Devil's Pool Victoria Falls is the world's ultimate infinity pool. The Devils Swimming Pool is available for an even shorter period as the water level has to be really low to allow for safe swimming. Although variable every year this is normally from late August to early JanuaryVictoria Falls is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the citizens of both Zambia and Zimbabwe no longer have fear of the "the smoke that thunders", and are successfully developing the tourism on both sides of the riverSource: Many Sources​</a>

                                            I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
Tape my eyes open to force reality (oh no, no)
Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
And some days I can't tell if my body belongs to me
I love everything
Fire's spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Shh
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one-way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music 'til the wick burns out
Hush
Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count 'em like the four-leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep</a>

He picked up, took it home and look after it lovingly, even though his wife complained bitterly about his wasting too much time on the creature.     After sometime the wing mended and, because the bird didn’t want the farmer to have kept on arguing with his wife all the time, it decided to go back to its nest.      When the farmer discovered that the bird was gone, he was also upset that he went out to look for it. Eventually, he found it again &amp; was greetedhappily by the whole family of the bird. As a sign of their thanks for his care and attention, the bird gave him a little box, and told him not to open it until he got home.      To his surprise, the farmer found the box full of precious stones. When his wife saw them, she decided that she too deserved a reward, and she went to see the birds. The bird gave her a little casket; this one was full of devils. The devils jumped on her soon as she opened the casket and chase her away. Left alone, the farmer went to live near his friend, the bird. There he built the hut of perfumed wood; and the birds decorated it with flowers of every. 1) What do we learn from the text?  a.

                                            Can you live alone? Long ago, a young man found life in the family in his village full of problems and sufferings. Quarrels, ill-feel, jealously, enmity – all were part of everyday life there.So he left his house and went to the jungle to live by himself. There he made a nice little hut with wood, bamboo and reeds. “Ah, how happy I am here!” said the man to himself.But, one day he found some mice in his hut. The little creatures soon made holes in the blanket. So, he brought a cat to kill the mice. The cat needed milk. So he brought a cow. The cow needed grass and hay. So, he brought a cowboy.The cowboy needs food. So he took a wife to cook meals. Then children were born to them, and the man found himself again in a family.So nobody can live alone unless they are either angels or devils. People need food, shelter, companions and cooperation. They need to help each other. And if they live in a family or community, their need can be fulfilled. Hence living in society can make people good and happy citizens.Answer these questions1. Why did the young man leave his house?2. Where did he make a hut? What did he make the hut with?3. Was the man is happy in his hut?4. How did he find himself again in a family?5. Where and how can a person be happy?6. What is the moral of the story?​</a>

                                            Mickey is only 12-year-old, but he has finished high school and is currently studying robotic engineering in MIT. He has been working hard on his project to create a mind-controlled exoskeleton that enables the user to move around by 'ordering' the exoskeleton to do so. He believes his invention will be very helpful to mankind, especially to disabled people who have lost their body motor control. He is very determined to develop this machine and hopes that those poor people will be using the machine in the near future and thus be able to have a better life. He has set a strict project plan and aims to finish it within 2 months time. He projects that the control center helmet will have been ready for use by the end of this month and hopefully people will have been using the machine by New Year.His quick progress is not of unfounded reason. When he was 5 years old, he lost his use of legs after he had been severely injured in a motor accident. He was accompanying his mother in the backseat of her car when a truck lost control and hit the car from the rear. Her mother regretted the accident very much, saying he would have been safe and sound at home if she hadn't decided to bring him along. Being a single parent, she had been raising Mike alone.It was certainly a difficult time for the mother and son.cari lah unsur subjek serta predikat dari cerita di atas dan tuliskan kalimat nya ​</a>

Real Madrid coach, Jose Mourinho, congratulates Sir Alex Ferguson on the success of Manchester United winning in the Premier League. He pleaded not surprised by the success of the Red Devils because they had the capacity for it.
“Sir Alex Ferguson has been doing what he did in his entire life, which is to win. I congratulate him. However, it is not surprising to me or the world that Ferguson will be back to win again,” said Mourinho as reported by the U.S..
Red Devils clinched his 20th Premier League after defeating Aston Villa 3-0 at Old Trafford Stadium, Monday or Tuesday (4/23/2013) early morning hrs. The Red Devils scored created Robin van Persie (2nd minute, 13th, 33rd).

                                            The Urban Legends of All Time
1. LA LLORONA
Yours truly grew up with this particular folktale, which originates in Mexico and is about a mother
named Maria (aka La Llorona) who threw her children into a river upon realizing that her
husband was unfaithful. She immediately regretted the impulsive act.
2. KUCHISAKE – ONNA / THE SLIT - MOUTHED WOMAN
Kuchisake-onna is a seemingly ordinary woman wearing a surgical mask, as though to protect
others from catching her cold. She appears before those walking alone at night, usually
children, and asks, ‘Am I beautiful?’
If you answer no, you are killed with the pair of scissors Kuchisake-onna carries. If you answer
yes, she takes off her mask to reveal her grotesque grin, a mouth that has been slit from ear to
ear. ‘How about now?’ she will ask; she will kill you if you say no, and cut you an identical smile
if you say yes. Rumor has it that a few answers will confuse Kuchisake-onna long enough for
you to escape: ‘You’re average,’. Kuchisake-onna was a woman disfigured by her husband
when he found out she was cheating. After he viciously cut her mouth, he asked her, ‘Who will
think you are beautiful now?’ 
3. BLOODY MARY
If you've ever walked into the bathroom, turned the lights on and off, and chanted "Bloody Mary,
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary" in front of the mirror. Because apparently this is how you. And the
good news is that sometimes Mary's nice. The bad news is she often appears as a corpse
covered in blood.
4. TEKE – TEKE
Teke-Teke was a schoolgirl who tripped on some train tracks at a critical moment. She was cut
in half by the oncoming locomotive. Now, Teke-Teke is a vengeful spirit who crawls around on
her hands and elbows, the dragging sound of her torso along the ground making the teke-
teke sound which gives her the name. Teke-Teke wanders around at night, slicing her victims in
half with a scythe to mimic her own disfigurement. Once her victim comes close enough, she
surprises them and reveals herself. You can only escape Teke-Teke if you can outrun her, but
watch out – she’s extremely fast.
5. THE GOATMAN OF MARYLAND
The half-human and half-goat hybrid monster who trolls around Maryland. According to urban
legend, the axe-wielding Goatman used to be a scientist, until an experiment involving goats
turned him into a goat and he started murdering everyone with his axe. 
6. MOTHMAN
Most people are somewhat familiar with this buggy. Mothman is a man who is also a moth. He
lives in West Virginia, and first showed up during the '60s, when several folks claimed to see
him.
7. THE LICKER
The story goes that one night a girl and her dog were home alone, so she had her dog sleep
under her bed because she was scared. In the middle of the night, she woke up to the sound of
dripping coming from the bathroom, but she was too freaked out to get up and check what it
was. So naturally, she put her hand down underneath her bed for comfort and was reassured
when her dog gave her a lick. The next morning, she walked into the bathroom only to find her
dog slaughtered and strung up from the shower rod, his blood dripping onto the floor. On the
wall, someone had scrawled the message, "HUMANS CAN LICK TOO." It's unclear if The
Licker is still out there licking
8. SLENDER MAN
Basically, urban legend tells of a scary man with super long floppy arms who lives in the woods
and preys on children. This fake story made its way into urban legend so fast and so furiously
that kids started believing Slender Man was real. In fact, there have been multiple crimes
attributed to Slender Man—including the high-profile case of two girls who were accused of
stabbing their classmate in his name.
9. KILLER IN THE BACKSEAT
A woman is driving home alone at night. Suddenly, the car behind her starts driving erratically
and flashing its high beams. Understandably, she assumes she's being stalked and rushes
home—getting her car safely into the garage so that the car behind her can't follow her in. And it
turns out that there was a man in her backseat wielding a knife the whole time, and the driver
behind her had only been flashing his lights to try and deter the knife-wielding man.
10. AKA MANTO / RED CAPE
The frightening tale of Aka Manto says that the handsome spirit of a man wearing a mask waits
in the stalls of ladies’ washrooms, usually the last stall in a line. Once seated, the specter’s
voice will ask, ‘Do you want red paper, or blue?’ If you say red, you suffer a violent death. If you
answer blue, you are suffocated until you turn blue and die. Deviating from these answer by,
say, asking for ordinary white paper, will only have ghostly hands appearing out of nowhere –
sometimes right out of the toilet you’re sitting on – and drag you down to Hell. But, fear not: the
way to avoid any of these fates is to politely refuse anything he offers.

                                            Mickey is only 12-year-old, but he has finished high school and is currently studying robotic engineering in MIT. He has been working hard on his project to create a mind-controlled exoskeleton that enables the user to move around by 'ordering' the exoskeleton to do so. He believes his invention will be very helpful to mankind, especially to disabled people who have lost their body motor control. He is very determined to develop this machine and hopes that those poor people will be using the machine in the near future and thus be able to have a better life. He has set a strict project plan and aims to finish it within 2 months time. He projects that the control center helmet will have been ready for use by the end of this month and hopefully people will have been using the machine by New Year.His quick progress is not of unfounded reason. When he was 5 years old, he lost his use of legs after he had been severely injured in a motor accident. He was accompanying his mother in the backseat of her car when a truck lost control and hit the car from the rear. Her mother regretted the accident very much, saying he would have been safe and sound at home if she hadn't decided to bring him along. Being a single parent, she had been raising Mike alone.It was certainly a difficult time for the mother and son.cari lah unsur subjek serta predikat dari cerita di atas dan tuliskan kalimat nya ​</a>

To the delight of the crow, some of the peacock feathers lay on the ground when the peacocks left. Crow flew down to the ground and stuck the feathers into his wings and tail. He attached a few sticking up from his head. "Now I am as beautiful as a peacock," he said. But, when he went to join them in their walking, the peacocks punched him and hit him. What a fuss! "You are not a peacock," they said, "Don't imitate us!" Bruised and still dragging some broken peacock feathers in his tail, he returned home. After all his insults, no one wanted his company!

Based on the text "Victoria falls", identify the passive sentences found in the text!Victoria FallsVictoria Falls constitutes one of the most spectacular natural wonders of the world. The local people call it "Mosi-oa-Tunya" which means the smoke that thunders. It is located in southern Africa on the Zambezi River at the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.The Victoria Falls is 1.708 meters wide, making it the largest curtain of water in the world. It drops between 90 m and 107 m into the Zambezi Gorge and an average of 550,000 cubic meters of water plummet over the edge every minute.David Livingstone who was the first European to cross Africa from south to north discovered this awe-inspiring waterfall in 1855. He was fascinated by the beauty of the falls. In 1857 Livingstone wrote that no one in England can even imagine the beauty of this scene. The statue of David Livingstone was erected at the Victoria Falls in Livingstone in November 2005. It features a full body replica of Dr Livingstone standing with his right holding his journal and his left hand raised to his forehead as he look upon the water falls. The falls and the surrounding area have been declared national parks and a World Heritage Site, thus preserving the area from excessive commercialization One special vantage point is across the Knife-edge Bridge, where visitors can have the finest view of the Eastern Cataract and the Main Falls as well as the Boiling Pot, where the river turns and heads down the Batoka Gorge. Other vantage points include the Falls Bridge, Devils Pool and the Lookout Tree, both of which command panoramic views across the Main Falls.Today one of the Victoria Falls Bridge's main attractions are historical guided tours focusing on the construction of the bridge, and which include a walking tour under the main deck. On the Zambian side, there is a small museum about the Bridge which is free to enter and has a cafe selling refreshments.Livingstone Island was opened in 1992 to provide exclusive and unique picnics on the edge of the Victoria Falls. It is a protected area that is only allowed a maximum of 16 people on at any one time. The utmost care is taken to protect and preserve the natural habitat of the area. There is also a railway museum in Livingstone, with several old steam trains, and is a good source of information for railway enthusiasts. The Livingstone Island tour is seasonal and can only be done when the water level of the Zambezi River is low enough to allow safe access to Livingstone Island. This is from approximately late June to early March.Devil's Pool Victoria Falls is the world's ultimate infinity pool.

Quarrels, ill-feel, jealously, enmity – all were part of everyday life there.So he left his house and went to the jungle to live by himself. There he made a nice little hut with wood, bamboo and reeds. “Ah, how happy I am here!” said the man to himself.But, one day he found some mice in his hut. The little creatures soon made holes in the blanket. So, he brought a cat to kill the mice. The cat needed milk. So he brought a cow. The cow needed grass and hay. So, he brought a cowboy.The cowboy needs food. So he took a wife to cook meals. Then children were born to them, and the man found himself again in a family.So nobody can live alone unless they are either angels or devils. People need food, shelter, companions and cooperation. They need to help each other. And if they live in a family or community, their need can be fulfilled. Hence living in society can make people good and happy citizens.Answer these questions1. Why did the young man leave his house?2. Where did he make a hut? What did he make the hut with?3. Was the man is happy in his hut?4. How did he find himself again in a family?5.

Real Madrid coach, Jose Mourinho, congratulates Sir Alex Ferguson on the success of Manchester United winning in the Premier League. He pleaded not surprised by the success of the Red Devils because they had the capacity for it.
“Sir Alex Ferguson has been doing what he did in his entire life, which is to win. I congratulate him. However, it is not surprising to me or the world that Ferguson will be back to win again,” said Mourinho as reported by the U.S..
Red Devils clinched his 20th Premier League after defeating Aston Villa 3-0 at Old Trafford Stadium, Monday or Tuesday (4/23/2013) early morning hrs. The Red Devils scored created Robin van Persie (2nd minute, 13th, 33rd).
The result is at once buried dreams of Manchester City to retain the title. The Blue Manchester ranked second and had the 16 points differentiate from Manchester United.

                            31. The Urban Legends of All Time
1. LA LLORONA
Yours truly grew up with this particular folktale, which originates in Mexico and is about a mother
named Maria (aka La Llorona) who threw her children into a river upon realizing that her
husband was unfaithful. She immediately regretted the impulsive act.
2. KUCHISAKE – ONNA / THE SLIT - MOUTHED WOMAN
Kuchisake-onna is a seemingly ordinary woman wearing a surgical mask, as though to protect
others from catching her cold. She appears before those walking alone at night, usually
children, and asks, ‘Am I beautiful?’
If you answer no, you are killed with the pair of scissors Kuchisake-onna carries. If you answer
yes, she takes off her mask to reveal her grotesque grin, a mouth that has been slit from ear to
ear. ‘How about now?’ she will ask; she will kill you if you say no, and cut you an identical smile
if you say yes. Rumor has it that a few answers will confuse Kuchisake-onna long enough for
you to escape: ‘You’re average,’. Kuchisake-onna was a woman disfigured by her husband
when he found out she was cheating. After he viciously cut her mouth, he asked her, ‘Who will
think you are beautiful now?’ 
3. BLOODY MARY
If you've ever walked into the bathroom, turned the lights on and off, and chanted "Bloody Mary,
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary" in front of the mirror. Because apparently this is how you. And the
good news is that sometimes Mary's nice. The bad news is she often appears as a corpse
covered in blood.
4. TEKE – TEKE
Teke-Teke was a schoolgirl who tripped on some train tracks at a critical moment. She was cut
in half by the oncoming locomotive. Now, Teke-Teke is a vengeful spirit who crawls around on
her hands and elbows, the dragging sound of her torso along the ground making the teke-
teke sound which gives her the name. Teke-Teke wanders around at night, slicing her victims in
half with a scythe to mimic her own disfigurement. Once her victim comes close enough, she
surprises them and reveals herself. You can only escape Teke-Teke if you can outrun her, but
watch out – she’s extremely fast.
5. THE GOATMAN OF MARYLAND
The half-human and half-goat hybrid monster who trolls around Maryland. According to urban
legend, the axe-wielding Goatman used to be a scientist, until an experiment involving goats
turned him into a goat and he started murdering everyone with his axe. 
6. MOTHMAN
Most people are somewhat familiar with this buggy. Mothman is a man who is also a moth. He
lives in West Virginia, and first showed up during the '60s, when several folks claimed to see
him.
7. THE LICKER
The story goes that one night a girl and her dog were home alone, so she had her dog sleep
under her bed because she was scared. In the middle of the night, she woke up to the sound of
dripping coming from the bathroom, but she was too freaked out to get up and check what it
was. So naturally, she put her hand down underneath her bed for comfort and was reassured
when her dog gave her a lick. The next morning, she walked into the bathroom only to find her
dog slaughtered and strung up from the shower rod, his blood dripping onto the floor. On the
wall, someone had scrawled the message, "HUMANS CAN LICK TOO." It's unclear if The
Licker is still out there licking
8. SLENDER MAN
Basically, urban legend tells of a scary man with super long floppy arms who lives in the woods
and preys on children. This fake story made its way into urban legend so fast and so furiously
that kids started believing Slender Man was real. In fact, there have been multiple crimes
attributed to Slender Man—including the high-profile case of two girls who were accused of
stabbing their classmate in his name.
9. KILLER IN THE BACKSEAT
A woman is driving home alone at night. Suddenly, the car behind her starts driving erratically
and flashing its high beams. Understandably, she assumes she's being stalked and rushes
home—getting her car safely into the garage so that the car behind her can't follow her in. And it
turns out that there was a man in her backseat wielding a knife the whole time, and the driver
behind her had only been flashing his lights to try and deter the knife-wielding man.
10. AKA MANTO / RED CAPE
The frightening tale of Aka Manto says that the handsome spirit of a man wearing a mask waits
in the stalls of ladies’ washrooms, usually the last stall in a line. Once seated, the specter’s
voice will ask, ‘Do you want red paper, or blue?’ If you say red, you suffer a violent death. If you
answer blue, you are suffocated until you turn blue and die. Deviating from these answer by,
say, asking for ordinary white paper, will only have ghostly hands appearing out of nowhere –
sometimes right out of the toilet you’re sitting on – and drag you down to Hell. But, fear not: the
way to avoid any of these fates is to politely refuse anything he offers.

1. LA LLORONA
</p><p>Anda benar-benar tumbuh dengan cerita rakyat khusus ini, yang berasal dari Meksiko dan bercerita tentang seorang ibu bernama Maria (alias La Llorona) yang melemparkan anak-anaknya ke sungai setelah menyadari bahwa suaminya tidak setia. Dia segera menyesali tindakan impulsif itu.
</p><p>2. KUCHISAKE - ONNA / THE SLIT - WANITA MULUT
</p><p>Kuchisake-onna adalah wanita yang tampaknya biasa mengenakan topeng bedah, seolah-olah untuk melindungi orang lain dari masuk angin. Dia muncul di depan mereka yang berjalan sendirian di malam hari, biasanya anak-anak, dan bertanya, "Apakah aku cantik?" Jika Anda menjawab tidak, Anda terbunuh dengan gunting gunting yang dibawa Kuchisake-onna. Jika Anda menjawab ya, ia melepaskan topengnya untuk mengungkapkan senyumnya yang aneh, mulut yang telah digorok dari telinga ke telinga. 'Bagaimana kalau sekarang?' Dia akan bertanya; dia akan membunuhmu jika kamu mengatakan tidak, dan memotong senyummu jika kamu menjawab ya. Rumor mengatakan bahwa beberapa jawaban akan membingungkan Kuchisake-onna cukup lama sehingga Anda bisa melarikan diri: 'Anda rata-rata,'. Kuchisake-onna adalah seorang wanita yang cacat oleh suaminya ketika dia tahu dia selingkuh. Setelah dia dengan kejam memotong mulutnya, dia bertanya, "Siapa yang akan berpikir kamu cantik sekarang?"
</p><p>3. BLOODY MARY
</p><p>Jika Anda pernah berjalan ke kamar mandi, menyalakan dan mematikan lampu, dan meneriakkan "Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary" di depan cermin. Karena ternyata begini caranya Anda.

</p><p>Teke-Teke adalah seorang siswi yang tersandung di jalur kereta api pada waktu yang genting. Dia terbelah dua oleh lokomotif yang sedang melaju. Sekarang, Teke-Teke adalah roh pembalas yang merangkak dengan tangan dan sikunya, suara seretan tubuhnya di sepanjang tanah membuat suara tek-teke yang akhirnya memberinya nama itu. Teke-Teke berkeliaran di malam hari, membelah korbannya menjadi dua dengan sabit untuk meniru kekejamannya sendiri. Begitu korbannya cukup dekat, dia mengejutkan mereka dan mengungkapkan dirinya. Anda hanya dapat melarikan diri dari Teke-Teke jika Anda dapat berlari lebih cepat darinya, tetapi waspadalah - dia sangat cepat.
</p><p>5. THE GOATMAN OF MARYLAND
</p><p>Monster hybrid setengah manusia dan setengah kambing yang bertingkah di sekitar Maryland. Menurut legenda urban, Goatman yang memegang kapak dulunya adalah seorang ilmuwan, sampai percobaan yang melibatkan kambing mengubahnya menjadi seekor kambing dan dia mulai membunuh semua orang dengan kapaknya.

                            33. Mickey is only 12-year-old, but he has finished high school and is currently studying robotic engineering in MIT. He has been working hard on his project to create a mind-controlled exoskeleton that enables the user to move around by 'ordering' the exoskeleton to do so. He believes his invention will be very helpful to mankind, especially to disabled people who have lost their body motor control. He is very determined to develop this machine and hopes that those poor people will be using the machine in the near future and thus be able to have a better life. He has set a strict project plan and aims to finish it within 2 months time. He projects that the control center helmet will have been ready for use by the end of this month and hopefully people will have been using the machine by New Year.His quick progress is not of unfounded reason. When he was 5 years old, he lost his use of legs after he had been severely injured in a motor accident. He was accompanying his mother in the backseat of her car when a truck lost control and hit the car from the rear. Her mother regretted the accident very much, saying he would have been safe and sound at home if she hadn't decided to bring him along. Being a single parent, she had been raising Mike alone.It was certainly a difficult time for the mother and son.cari lah unsur subjek serta predikat dari cerita di atas dan tuliskan kalimat nya ​</h2><br />

He attached a few sticking up from his head. "Now I am as beautiful as a peacock," he said. But, when he went to join them in their walking, the peacocks punched him and hit him. What a fuss! "You are not a peacock," they said, "Don't imitate us!" Bruised and still dragging some broken peacock feathers in his tail, he returned home. After all his insults, no one wanted his company!
