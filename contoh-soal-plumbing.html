                                            House A house is a building that functions as a home, ranging from rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes to complex, fixed structures of wood, brick, concrete or other materials containing plumbing, ventilation and electrical systems. Many houses have several large rooms and several small rooms with their specialized functions. Most modern houses usually consist of a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen or cooking area, and a living room. Houses use a various roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space. Houses may have doors and locks to secure the dwelling space from burglars or other trespassers. A house may have a separate dining room or an integrated eating area with another room. Some large houses in North America even have a recreation room. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens may share part of the house with humans. A social unit living in a house is known as a household. (Report text)​</a>

                                            Lightning is sometimes beautiful to see, but it is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena known to man. Many people die each year from being struck by lightning. Lightning comes from clouds, but how exactly does this happen? Like a battery, a cloud contains both positive and negative charges. The positive charges are at the top and the negative charges are at the bottom. Many scientists believe that these charges are the result of evaporation and condensation of water vapors in the clouds. As the cloud gets bigger with more and more water vapor collected, more and more positive and negative charges will occur. The cloud then becomes like a great big capacitor in the sky. A capacitor is an electrical device that consists of two conductive surfaces separated by an insulating media. Gradually, there is an electrical build-up, which will eventually need an outlet of release. As the cloud builds up a strong electrical field, the air around the cloud begins to break down. This means that the air is separated into positive ions and electrons. We can say now that the air has become ionized. This ionized air or plasma is an excellent conductor of electricity. As the ionized air increases in size, the need for release causes an electric highway to be built towards the Earth. This electrical highway is shaped like a stepladder. One cloud will have many stepladders branching out from it. All these stepladders are looking for what is known as positive streamers. Streamers are the result of objects on the earth reacting to the strong electric field. Anything can produce a streamer, even the human body. The streamers stretch upward as the stepladders approach downward, bridging the gap. Once the streamer and stepladder meet, the highway is complete for the flow of electricity from the cloud to the earth. Following the flow of tremendous amounts of electricity, there is also a great deal of heat. The level of heat is even hotter than the surface of the sun and this is what causes the brilliant, white-blue flash of light, called lightning.The air around the bolt of lightning is heated to a very high temperature in a very short time and it explodes in a loud bang. This loud sound is what is known as thunder. Thunder is the shockwave radiating away from the strike path. This shockwave is powerful enough to damage buildings, people and other objects if they are near enough. However, the shockwave will reduce in intensity as it travels further and further away from its originating point. If you are caught outside in a storm, look for appropriate shelter. Do not hide under trees or any tall objects. Never lie down on the ground, as the current can flow from the strike point through the ground to you. If indoors, do not use phones. If you must make an emergency call, use a cordless phone or a cellular phone. Also stay away from plumbing pipes or any metallic objects that have a chance of conducting the current to you.Find 10 technical words from the text​</a>

1. In Labadee, Haiti, Royal Caribbean has a private beach. It’s separated from the rest of the island by a tall black iron fence that is neatly tucked away just beyond the tree line. One wonders if it’s meant to keep the tourists in or the locals out. Nevertheless, while at the private beach, tourists can relax in hammocks between two palm trees and look out over crystal clear, blue ocean water or swim with the colorful tropical fish, like in the postcards and travel advertisements.
 Yes, this paragraph is unified
 No, this paragraph is not unified
2. The beach at Labadee is exactly what one would picture when thinking of spending a lazy day on a tropical island. It conforms to the picture shown in advertisements and television commercials rather than to the reality of life for most people of Haiti. As Walker says in “The Loss of the Creature," rather than experiencing something real, the tourist is satisfied by the degree to which the place conforms to a preformed idea (Percy). In other words, the Royal Caribbean tourists are happy simply because Haiti fits their preconceived idea of a tropical island. They happily consume the sandy beech and palm trees like they would consume a bag of Doritos.

 No, this paragraph is not unified
3. My parents are a good example of people who saw great cultural change. Both of my parents had been raised during the Depression era. They met and married while they were both in their mid-twenties, an age considered "late" for betrothal in the early 1950’s. They chose to live in a modest suburban house in a small development in New Jersey. Each house had its own unique look, unlike the tract houses becoming common at this time. My family’s house was quite modern at the time, compared to the farmhouse my mother grew up in. The rear entrance was the more commonly used. Along with my father’s reclining chair, the L-shaped couch made the den an inviting place. Electricity was wired throughout the home, and overhead lights adorned each room. The dining room was used for special occasions such as birthdays or holidays. The kitchen was compact with all its modern conveniences. Indoor plumbing made a dishwasher possible, and a gas stove proved to be far more efficient that the wood burning stove.

4. The language my Hispanic co-workers speak is more than the Spanish language. When I walk into their offices, I see flavors of their culture sprinkled everywhere. One flavor is the small, round purple, pink, red Mexican toy sitting on the desk beckoning to be played with. Another flavor is a purple, pink, red and white colored shawl with white fringe dangling from its edges that is draped over a chair. And yet another is a pencil drawn picture of a small Mexican village hanging on the wall. I love these things and treasure them as much as my co-workers do. At office potlucks, I love eating and learning how to cook tortillas filled with meat, refried beans, and melted cheeses. No matter how I try to cook the same meal, it just doesn’t taste the same. I love that Latin flavor
 And yet another is a pencil drawn picture of a small Mexican village hanging on the wall
 No matter how I try to cook the same meal, it just doesn’t taste the same.
5. Among the residents of Coalinga are different generations from infants to elderly citizens. Because this community is so small there is a low crime rate. This makes Coalinga a safe place to raise children or to retire. Perhaps the largest portion of the population is young families with children in the local schools. Children are seen playing while parents work hard in the yard, and the retired can be found enjoying a day at the senior center.

Sebaliknya, objek pada kalimat aktif berubah menjadi subjek pada kalimat pasif.  Selalu dibentuk dengan menggunakan pola TOBE+ VERB 3 (Past particile).
Tobe yang digunakan sesuai dengan pola tenses dari kalimat aktif.  Terkadang menggunakan kata by jika yang melakukan aksi/perbuatan pada kalimat aktif perlu dan sangat penting untuk diketahui.  <p><strong>Passive Voice pada beberapa tense:  </strong></p><p><strong>1.

                            17. House A house is a building that functions as a home, ranging from rudimentary huts of nomadic tribes to complex, fixed structures of wood, brick, concrete or other materials containing plumbing, ventilation and electrical systems. Many houses have several large rooms and several small rooms with their specialized functions. Most modern houses usually consist of a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen or cooking area, and a living room. Houses use a various roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space. Houses may have doors and locks to secure the dwelling space from burglars or other trespassers. A house may have a separate dining room or an integrated eating area with another room. Some large houses in North America even have a recreation room. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens may share part of the house with humans. A social unit living in a house is known as a household. (Report text)​</h2><br />

                            22. Lightning is sometimes beautiful to see, but it is one of the most dangerous natural phenomena known to man. Many people die each year from being struck by lightning. Lightning comes from clouds, but how exactly does this happen? Like a battery, a cloud contains both positive and negative charges. The positive charges are at the top and the negative charges are at the bottom. Many scientists believe that these charges are the result of evaporation and condensation of water vapors in the clouds. As the cloud gets bigger with more and more water vapor collected, more and more positive and negative charges will occur. The cloud then becomes like a great big capacitor in the sky. A capacitor is an electrical device that consists of two conductive surfaces separated by an insulating media. Gradually, there is an electrical build-up, which will eventually need an outlet of release. As the cloud builds up a strong electrical field, the air around the cloud begins to break down. This means that the air is separated into positive ions and electrons. We can say now that the air has become ionized. This ionized air or plasma is an excellent conductor of electricity. As the ionized air increases in size, the need for release causes an electric highway to be built towards the Earth. This electrical highway is shaped like a stepladder. One cloud will have many stepladders branching out from it. All these stepladders are looking for what is known as positive streamers. Streamers are the result of objects on the earth reacting to the strong electric field. Anything can produce a streamer, even the human body. The streamers stretch upward as the stepladders approach downward, bridging the gap. Once the streamer and stepladder meet, the highway is complete for the flow of electricity from the cloud to the earth. Following the flow of tremendous amounts of electricity, there is also a great deal of heat. The level of heat is even hotter than the surface of the sun and this is what causes the brilliant, white-blue flash of light, called lightning.The air around the bolt of lightning is heated to a very high temperature in a very short time and it explodes in a loud bang. This loud sound is what is known as thunder. Thunder is the shockwave radiating away from the strike path. This shockwave is powerful enough to damage buildings, people and other objects if they are near enough. However, the shockwave will reduce in intensity as it travels further and further away from its originating point. If you are caught outside in a storm, look for appropriate shelter. Do not hide under trees or any tall objects. Never lie down on the ground, as the current can flow from the strike point through the ground to you. If indoors, do not use phones. If you must make an emergency call, use a cordless phone or a cellular phone. Also stay away from plumbing pipes or any metallic objects that have a chance of conducting the current to you.Find 10 technical words from the text​</h2><br />

1. In Labadee, Haiti, Royal Caribbean has a private beach. It’s separated from the rest of the island by a tall black iron fence that is neatly tucked away just beyond the tree line. One wonders if it’s meant to keep the tourists in or the locals out. Nevertheless, while at the private beach, tourists can relax in hammocks between two palm trees and look out over crystal clear, blue ocean water or swim with the colorful tropical fish, like in the postcards and travel advertisements.
 Yes, this paragraph is unified
 No, this paragraph is not unified
2. The beach at Labadee is exactly what one would picture when thinking of spending a lazy day on a tropical island. It conforms to the picture shown in advertisements and television commercials rather than to the reality of life for most people of Haiti. As Walker says in “The Loss of the Creature," rather than experiencing something real, the tourist is satisfied by the degree to which the place conforms to a preformed idea (Percy). In other words, the Royal Caribbean tourists are happy simply because Haiti fits their preconceived idea of a tropical island. They happily consume the sandy beech and palm trees like they would consume a bag of Doritos.

 No, this paragraph is not unified
3. My parents are a good example of people who saw great cultural change. Both of my parents had been raised during the Depression era. They met and married while they were both in their mid-twenties, an age considered "late" for betrothal in the early 1950’s. They chose to live in a modest suburban house in a small development in New Jersey. Each house had its own unique look, unlike the tract houses becoming common at this time. My family’s house was quite modern at the time, compared to the farmhouse my mother grew up in. The rear entrance was the more commonly used. Along with my father’s reclining chair, the L-shaped couch made the den an inviting place. Electricity was wired throughout the home, and overhead lights adorned each room. The dining room was used for special occasions such as birthdays or holidays. The kitchen was compact with all its modern conveniences. Indoor plumbing made a dishwasher possible, and a gas stove proved to be far more efficient that the wood burning stove.

4. The language my Hispanic co-workers speak is more than the Spanish language. When I walk into their offices, I see flavors of their culture sprinkled everywhere. One flavor is the small, round purple, pink, red Mexican toy sitting on the desk beckoning to be played with. Another flavor is a purple, pink, red and white colored shawl with white fringe dangling from its edges that is draped over a chair. And yet another is a pencil drawn picture of a small Mexican village hanging on the wall. I love these things and treasure them as much as my co-workers do. At office potlucks, I love eating and learning how to cook tortillas filled with meat, refried beans, and melted cheeses. No matter how I try to cook the same meal, it just doesn’t taste the same. I love that Latin flavor
 And yet another is a pencil drawn picture of a small Mexican village hanging on the wall
 No matter how I try to cook the same meal, it just doesn’t taste the same.
5. Among the residents of Coalinga are different generations from infants to elderly citizens. Because this community is so small there is a low crime rate. This makes Coalinga a safe place to raise children or to retire. Perhaps the largest portion of the population is young families with children in the local schools. Children are seen playing while parents work hard in the yard, and the retired can be found enjoying a day at the senior center.
