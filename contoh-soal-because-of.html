It's rarely to take a vacation because I'm very busy.          The way to Santolo beach is quite good, and the view is really beautiful. On our left and right is full of rice fields and many coconut trees along the way. But when we nearly arrived, there was a long traffic jam so we hardly to get in into the beach. I guess this was because of the Idul Fitri holiday, so people want to go to beach too. Then we just take a walk to the beach because it was not far. Fortunately the weather was not too hot on that day.          After we arrived, the beach was so crowded. But we still enjoyed the time by took pictures, swimming, playing sand, and go around the beach by boat. We stay overnight in the inn that we have rent before.          We got up so early in the morning that we could enjoy sunrise landscape at the beach. My cousin playing with white sand and I took a picture of him.          A day at Santolo beach felt so short, we were quite tired for playing a whole day, but we were very happy.Kasih Contoh Soal Recount Text Nya Dong​</a>

                                            Read the following text and answer number 1-5!
In total, the plant has need of at least 16 elements, of which the most important are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.
The plan obtains carbon and hydrogen dioxide from the atmosphere; other nutrients are taken up from the soil. Although the plant contains sodium, iodine, and cobalt, these are apparently not essential. This is also true of silicon and alumunium.
Overall chemical analyses indicate that the total supply of nutrients in soils is usually high in comparison with the requirements of crop plants. Much of this potential supply, however, is bound tightly in forms that are not released to crops fast enough to give satisfactory growth. Because of this, the farmer is interested in measuring the available nutrient supply as contrasted to the total quantities.

It is one of the highest mountain areas in Africa, and the World Heritage List (WHL) calls it 'one of the most spectacular landscapes in the world'. It is also important for its wildlife. Rare animals like the Gelada baboon and the Simien fox live there. It is also the only place in the world where you can find the Walia ibex, a type of goat.

Read the following text!
The latest round in an ongoing debate over global-warming trends claims that warming has indeed slowed down this century. An obvious slowing in the rise of global temperatures was recorded at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This was referred to as a "hiatus" or a "pause". This hiatus was first observed several years ago. Climate-change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped permanently. But in June the previous year, a study in science claimed that the hiatus was just an artifact which disappears when biases in temperature data are corrected.
Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim. They argue in Nature Climate Change that even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real. "There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing," says lead author John Fyfe. "We can't ignore it." Fyfe uses the term "slowdown" rather than "hiatus". He also stresses that it does not in any way weaken global-warming theory.
The study that questioned the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The finding showed differences in temperature readings from ships and buoys. This effectively increased the record about warming. The researchers also extended the record to include 2014. This set a new record high for average temperatures.
Thomas Karl, director of National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, calculated the rate of global warming between 1950 and 1999 as being 0.113°C per decade. This was similar to the 0.116°C a decade calculated for 2000-14. This, Karl said, meant that an assessment done by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 showing that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
1. The passage above mainly discusses about….
a. the hiatus observation was first carried out several years ago
b. the reason why global warming is slowing down in this century
c. global warming is a verifiable issue in the space of a decade
d. the contention about global warming and whether it is indeed slowing this period
e. the view of study in science that the hiatus is an artifact which vanishes
The word "prominent" in paragraph 2 means….
a. well-known
b. promenade
c. shrewd
d. indolent
e. magnificent
3. Why have some claimed that global warming a fabricated issue?
1. Because there’s no valid data to prove that global warming is real.
2. Since the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record upheld by the US NOAA.
3. As an assessment done on Climate Change presenting that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
4. For the researchers is countering that in Nature Climate Change even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real.
5. Because of the diversification in temperature readings from ships and buoys, the study found.</a>

Measles, a childhood disease, has caused suffering to mankind for thousands of years. However, the search for an effective measles vaccine lasted two hundred years and has finally ended in success. Now, for the first time, measles is a preventable disease. You may ask, "How is this important to children?" Every year measles kills twice as many Americans as polio does. More children die from measles than from any other common childhood disease. Also complications of some degree occur in about one child out of six. Most complication include pneumonia and ear disorders. Another after-effect of measles-brain damage is less common, but it can have such serious consequence that it deserves special attention. Brain damage due to measles sounds like something far away from our experience. In reality, it is not. Like other injury, damage to the brain can be very slight or very severe. It is quite possible that we have never seen or heard a child who has severe brain damage – the child would either have died or would be in an institution. However, in medical research a relation has been found between measles and such things as behavior problems, personality changes and dulling of metal ability. For example, a child may be bad-tempered or a little slow to learn after he has recovered from measles
One of the important findings of the research on measles is that ....
a.        children who have got measles may become difficult to handle because of their behavior.
b.        in reality, there are no measles patients who get brain damage.
c.        personality changes already occur at the time a child has measles.
d.        measles can cause children to become physically handicapped.
e.        measles is the first killer of childhood disease in the world</a>

A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra, a woman and her son lived. They were Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a single parent because Malin Kundang's father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang had to live hard with his mother.
Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sold the caught fish in the town. 
One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant's ship which was being raided by a small band of pirates. He helped the merchant. With his brave and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so happy and thanked to him. In return the merchant asked Malin Kundang to sail with him. To get a better life, Malin Kundang agreed. He left his mother alone.
Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and was helped by many ship crews loading trading goods. Perfectly he had a beautiful wife too. When he was sailing his trading journey, his ship landed on a beach near a small village. The villagers recognized him. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”.
An old woman ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She was Malin Kundang’s mother. She wanted to hug him, released her sadness of being lonely after so long time. Unfortunately, when the mother came, Malin Kundang who was in front of his well dressed wife and his ship crews denied meeting that old lonely woman. For three times her mother begged Malin Kundang and for three times he yelled at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her "Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!" After that he ordered his crews to set sail. He would leave the old mother again but in that time she was full of both sadness and angriness.
Finally, enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn't apologize. Malin Kundang just laughed and really set sail.
In the quiet sea, suddenly a thunderstorm came. His huge ship was wrecked and it was too late for Malin Kundang to apologize. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship. He fell on a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse. Suddenly, he turned into a stone.

Loneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious public health risks affecting a significant number of people in the United States and putting them at risk for dementia and other serious medical conditions. A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) points out that more than one-third of adults aged 45 and older feel lonely, and nearly one-fourth of adults aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated. Older adults are at increased risk for loneliness and social isolation because they are more likely to face factors such as living alone, the loss of family or friends, chronic illness, and hearing loss.
Although it’s hard to measure social isolation and loneliness precisely, there is strong evidence that many adults aged 50 and older are socially isolated or lonely in ways that put their health at risk. Recent studies found that social isolation significantly increased a person’s risk of premature death from all causes, a risk that may rival those of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Poor social relationships (characterized by social isolation or loneliness) was also associated with a 29% increased risk of heart disease. Loneliness among heart failure patients was associated with a nearly 4 times increased risk of death, 68% increased risk of hospitalization, and 57% increased risk of emergency department visits.

d.	convey the pain and sadness experienced by lonely and socially isolated elderly based on research

a.	Families staying with elderly
b.	People living around elderly
c.	Pensioners who have just left their jobs
d.	Senior citizens living alone in the suburbs
e.	Employers having old workers in their companies
3. From the last paragraph, we can infer that …

b.	Feeling lonely aggravates the heart condition of the elderly.
c.	Heart disease is the worst ailment that a lonely older person will suffer from.
d.	The older people get, the more lonely they will feel.

Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and was helped by many ship crews loading trading goods. Perfectly he had a beautiful wife too. When he was sailing his trading journey, his ship landed on a beach near a small village. The villagers recognized him. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”.
An old woman ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She was Malin Kundang’s mother. She wanted to hug him, released her sadness of being lonely after so long time. Unfortunately, when the mother came, Malin Kundang who was in front of his well dressed wife and his ship crews denied meeting that old lonely woman. For three times her mother begged Malin Kundang and for three times he yelled at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her "Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!" After that he ordered his crews to set sail. He would leave the old mother again but in that time she was full of both sadness and angriness.
Finally, enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn't apologize. Malin Kundang just laughed and really set sail.
In the quiet sea, suddenly a thunderstorm came. His huge ship was wrecked and it was too late for Malin Kundang to apologize. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship. He fell on a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse. Suddenly, he turned into a stone.

                                            ScotlandA lot of people think that Scotland is a part of England but this is untrue. Scotland is, in fact, a part of Great Britain.It is governed from London but in many ways it is a separate nation. It has its own capital city, Edinburgh, its own lawsand its own stamps. It even has its own language. Gaelic, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.There are only about five million Scots, and most of them live in the southern half of country called 'Lowlands', wherethe major cities are situated.But most holiday visitors to Scotland go to the Highlands because of the high mountains and deep volleys, cleanrivers and cold 'lochs'. The Highlands are home to many rare birds and animals, like the golden eagle and the wildcat.which are found nowhere else in Britain. It is a lonely, wild and empty land. Only two per cent of the British population livethere and the population is getting smaller all the time. There is very little work so most of the young people who are bornthere have to move south to find a job. Perhaps the Highlands of Scotland will become the last great wilderness of Europe.14.

With his brave and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so happy and thanked to him. In return the merchant asked Malin Kundang to sail with him. To get a better life, Malin Kundang agreed. He left his mother alone.

Read the following text!
Over the last two decades, the use of ICT has been an important topic in education. On the one hand, studies have shown that ICT can enhance teaching and learning outcomes. For example, in science and mathematics education, scholars have documented that the use of ICT can improve students’ conceptual understanding, problem solving, and team working skills. Consequently, most curriculum documents state the importance of ICT and encourage school teachers to use them. However, teachers need to specifically trained in order to integrate ICT in their teaching.
Schools are known to be resistant to innovation and change, however, the spread of ICT is beginning to affect how teachers teach. One of the current issues about the use of ICT is how it is integrated into the curriculum. The curriculum document provide arguments for introducing ICT in the school setting. Therefore, schools expect that graduates from teacher education programs have a reasonable knowledge of how to use ICT. However, this may not be the case because most current teachers’ pre-service preparation, and subsequent in-service courses were designed by using traditional educational technology and settings. Thus, the participants in these courses are not familiar with the processes, interaction patterns, features, and possibilities of teaching learning processes based on ICT.
Effective development of pre-service teachers’ ICT proficiency does not seem to be a direct process, but is the one asking for a careful, complex approach. First, a need assessment is important to find out what ICT skills and knowledge teachers need at schools. Second, designers of teacher education programs should know the pre-service teachers’ perceptions of ICT and their attitudes toward ICT integration into curriculum. Third, teacher education programs need to consider the two typical arguments that support the ICT use in schools.

In total, the plant has need of at least 16 elements, of which the most important are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and magnesium.
The plan obtains carbon and hydrogen dioxide from the atmosphere; other nutrients are taken up from the soil. Although the plant contains sodium, iodine, and cobalt, these are apparently not essential. This is also true of silicon and alumunium.
Overall chemical analyses indicate that the total supply of nutrients in soils is usually high in comparison with the requirements of crop plants. Much of this potential supply, however, is bound tightly in forms that are not released to crops fast enough to give satisfactory growth. Because of this, the farmer is interested in measuring the available nutrient supply as contrasted to the total quantities.

Read the following text!
The latest round in an ongoing debate over global-warming trends claims that warming has indeed slowed down this century. An obvious slowing in the rise of global temperatures was recorded at the beginning of the twenty-first century. This was referred to as a "hiatus" or a "pause". This hiatus was first observed several years ago. Climate-change skeptics have used this as evidence that global warming has stopped permanently. But in June the previous year, a study in science claimed that the hiatus was just an artifact which disappears when biases in temperature data are corrected.
Now a prominent group of researchers is countering that claim. They argue in Nature Climate Change that even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real. "There is this mismatch between what the climate models are producing and what the observations are showing," says lead author John Fyfe. "We can't ignore it." Fyfe uses the term "slowdown" rather than "hiatus". He also stresses that it does not in any way weaken global-warming theory.
The study that questioned the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record maintained by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The finding showed differences in temperature readings from ships and buoys. This effectively increased the record about warming. The researchers also extended the record to include 2014. This set a new record high for average temperatures.
Thomas Karl, director of National Centers for Environmental Information in Asheville, calculated the rate of global warming between 1950 and 1999 as being 0.113°C per decade. This was similar to the 0.116°C a decade calculated for 2000-14. This, Karl said, meant that an assessment done by the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2013 showing that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
1. The passage above mainly discusses about….
a. the hiatus observation was first carried out several years ago
b. the reason why global warming is slowing down in this century
c. global warming is a verifiable issue in the space of a decade
d. the contention about global warming and whether it is indeed slowing this period
e. the view of study in science that the hiatus is an artifact which vanishes
The word "prominent" in paragraph 2 means….
a. well-known
b. promenade
c. shrewd
d. indolent
e. magnificent
3. Why have some claimed that global warming a fabricated issue?
1. Because there’s no valid data to prove that global warming is real.
2. Since the existence of the slowdown corrected known biases in the surface temperature record upheld by the US NOAA.
3. As an assessment done on Climate Change presenting that warming had slowed was no longer valid.
4. For the researchers is countering that in Nature Climate Change even after correcting these biases the slowdown was real.

Measles, a childhood disease, has caused suffering to mankind for thousands of years. However, the search for an effective measles vaccine lasted two hundred years and has finally ended in success. Now, for the first time, measles is a preventable disease. You may ask, "How is this important to children?" Every year measles kills twice as many Americans as polio does. More children die from measles than from any other common childhood disease. Also complications of some degree occur in about one child out of six. Most complication include pneumonia and ear disorders. Another after-effect of measles-brain damage is less common, but it can have such serious consequence that it deserves special attention. Brain damage due to measles sounds like something far away from our experience. In reality, it is not. Like other injury, damage to the brain can be very slight or very severe. It is quite possible that we have never seen or heard a child who has severe brain damage – the child would either have died or would be in an institution. However, in medical research a relation has been found between measles and such things as behavior problems, personality changes and dulling of metal ability. For example, a child may be bad-tempered or a little slow to learn after he has recovered from measles
One of the important findings of the research on measles is that ....
a.        children who have got measles may become difficult to handle because of their behavior.
b.        in reality, there are no measles patients who get brain damage.
c.        personality changes already occur at the time a child has measles.
d.        measles can cause children to become physically handicapped.
e.        measles is the first killer of childhood disease in the world</h2><br />

A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra, a woman and her son lived. They were Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a single parent because Malin Kundang's father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang had to live hard with his mother.
Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sold the caught fish in the town. 
One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant's ship which was being raided by a small band of pirates. He helped the merchant. With his brave and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so happy and thanked to him. In return the merchant asked Malin Kundang to sail with him. To get a better life, Malin Kundang agreed. He left his mother alone.
Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and was helped by many ship crews loading trading goods. Perfectly he had a beautiful wife too. When he was sailing his trading journey, his ship landed on a beach near a small village. The villagers recognized him. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”.
An old woman ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She was Malin Kundang’s mother. She wanted to hug him, released her sadness of being lonely after so long time. Unfortunately, when the mother came, Malin Kundang who was in front of his well dressed wife and his ship crews denied meeting that old lonely woman. For three times her mother begged Malin Kundang and for three times he yelled at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her "Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!" After that he ordered his crews to set sail. He would leave the old mother again but in that time she was full of both sadness and angriness.
Finally, enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn't apologize. Malin Kundang just laughed and really set sail.
In the quiet sea, suddenly a thunderstorm came. His huge ship was wrecked and it was too late for Malin Kundang to apologize. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship. He fell on a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse. Suddenly, he turned into a stone.

Loneliness and social isolation in older adults are serious public health risks affecting a significant number of people in the United States and putting them at risk for dementia and other serious medical conditions. A report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) points out that more than one-third of adults aged 45 and older feel lonely, and nearly one-fourth of adults aged 65 and older are considered to be socially isolated. Older adults are at increased risk for loneliness and social isolation because they are more likely to face factors such as living alone, the loss of family or friends, chronic illness, and hearing loss.
Although it’s hard to measure social isolation and loneliness precisely, there is strong evidence that many adults aged 50 and older are socially isolated or lonely in ways that put their health at risk. Recent studies found that social isolation significantly increased a person’s risk of premature death from all causes, a risk that may rival those of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Poor social relationships (characterized by social isolation or loneliness) was also associated with a 29% increased risk of heart disease. Loneliness among heart failure patients was associated with a nearly 4 times increased risk of death, 68% increased risk of hospitalization, and 57% increased risk of emergency department visits.

d.	convey the pain and sadness experienced by lonely and socially isolated elderly based on research
e.	tell about the loneliness and unhappiness felt by the elderly who are socially isolated, as well as research findings
2. To whom is the text likely addressed?
a.	Families staying with elderly
b.	People living around elderly
c.	Pensioners who have just left their jobs
d.	Senior citizens living alone in the suburbs
e.	Employers having old workers in their companies

A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra, a woman and her son lived. They were Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a single parent because Malin Kundang's father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang had to live hard with his mother.
Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sold the caught fish in the town. 
One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant's ship which was being raided by a small band of pirates. He helped the merchant. With his brave and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so happy and thanked to him. In return the merchant asked Malin Kundang to sail with him. To get a better life, Malin Kundang agreed. He left his mother alone.
Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and was helped by many ship crews loading trading goods. Perfectly he had a beautiful wife too. When he was sailing his trading journey, his ship landed on a beach near a small village. The villagers recognized him. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”.
An old woman ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She was Malin Kundang’s mother. She wanted to hug him, released her sadness of being lonely after so long time. Unfortunately, when the mother came, Malin Kundang who was in front of his well dressed wife and his ship crews denied meeting that old lonely woman. For three times her mother begged Malin Kundang and for three times he yelled at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her "Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!" After that he ordered his crews to set sail. He would leave the old mother again but in that time she was full of both sadness and angriness.
Finally, enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn't apologize. Malin Kundang just laughed and really set sail.
In the quiet sea, suddenly a thunderstorm came. His huge ship was wrecked and it was too late for Malin Kundang to apologize. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship. He fell on a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse. Suddenly, he turned into a stone.

                            25. ScotlandA lot of people think that Scotland is a part of England but this is untrue. Scotland is, in fact, a part of Great Britain.It is governed from London but in many ways it is a separate nation. It has its own capital city, Edinburgh, its own lawsand its own stamps. It even has its own language. Gaelic, spoken now by only a few people in the islands.There are only about five million Scots, and most of them live in the southern half of country called 'Lowlands', wherethe major cities are situated.But most holiday visitors to Scotland go to the Highlands because of the high mountains and deep volleys, cleanrivers and cold 'lochs'. The Highlands are home to many rare birds and animals, like the golden eagle and the wildcat.which are found nowhere else in Britain. It is a lonely, wild and empty land. Only two per cent of the British population livethere and the population is getting smaller all the time. There is very little work so most of the young people who are bornthere have to move south to find a job. Perhaps the Highlands of Scotland will become the last great wilderness of Europe.14.

A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra, a woman and her son lived. They were Malin Kundang and her mother. Her mother was a single parent because Malin Kundang's father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang had to live hard with his mother.
Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sold the caught fish in the town. 
One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant's ship which was being raided by a small band of pirates. He helped the merchant. With his brave and power, Malin Kundang defeated the pirates. The merchant was so happy and thanked to him. In return the merchant asked Malin Kundang to sail with him. To get a better life, Malin Kundang agreed. He left his mother alone.
Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and was helped by many ship crews loading trading goods. Perfectly he had a beautiful wife too. When he was sailing his trading journey, his ship landed on a beach near a small village. The villagers recognized him. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”.
An old woman ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She was Malin Kundang’s mother. She wanted to hug him, released her sadness of being lonely after so long time. Unfortunately, when the mother came, Malin Kundang who was in front of his well dressed wife and his ship crews denied meeting that old lonely woman. For three times her mother begged Malin Kundang and for three times he yelled at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her "Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!" After that he ordered his crews to set sail. He would leave the old mother again but in that time she was full of both sadness and angriness.
Finally, enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn't apologize. Malin Kundang just laughed and really set sail.
In the quiet sea, suddenly a thunderstorm came. His huge ship was wrecked and it was too late for Malin Kundang to apologize. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship. He fell on a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse. Suddenly, he turned into a stone.

Read the following text!
Over the last two decades, the use of ICT has been an important topic in education. On the one hand, studies have shown that ICT can enhance teaching and learning outcomes. For example, in science and mathematics education, scholars have documented that the use of ICT can improve students’ conceptual understanding, problem solving, and team working skills. Consequently, most curriculum documents state the importance of ICT and encourage school teachers to use them. However, teachers need to specifically trained in order to integrate ICT in their teaching.
Schools are known to be resistant to innovation and change, however, the spread of ICT is beginning to affect how teachers teach. One of the current issues about the use of ICT is how it is integrated into the curriculum. The curriculum document provide arguments for introducing ICT in the school setting. Therefore, schools expect that graduates from teacher education programs have a reasonable knowledge of how to use ICT. However, this may not be the case because most current teachers’ pre-service preparation, and subsequent in-service courses were designed by using traditional educational technology and settings. Thus, the participants in these courses are not familiar with the processes, interaction patterns, features, and possibilities of teaching learning processes based on ICT.
Effective development of pre-service teachers’ ICT proficiency does not seem to be a direct process, but is the one asking for a careful, complex approach. First, a need assessment is important to find out what ICT skills and knowledge teachers need at schools. Second, designers of teacher education programs should know the pre-service teachers’ perceptions of ICT and their attitudes toward ICT integration into curriculum. Third, teacher education programs need to consider the two typical arguments that support the ICT use in schools.

b.         Studies have shown that ICT can enrich teaching and learning end result
c.        The use of ICT has been an insignificant topic in education. Also, studies have shown that ICT can enhance teaching and learning outcomes.
d.        Over the last two decades, the use of ICT has been an important topic in educational method.
e.        Over the preceding two decades, studies have exposed that ICT can increase teaching and learning outcomes.
2.  Based on the passage, paragraph 1 most likely discusses….
