Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Snow White. She lived with her Aunt and Uncle because her parents were dead.
One day she heard her Uncle and Aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.
Snow White did not want her Uncle and Aunt to do this so she decided it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away from home when her Aunt and Uncle were having breakfast. She ran away into the woods.
She was very tired and hungry.
Then she saw this little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. They went inside. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs. The dwarfs said, “What s your name?” “I am Snow Said,” she said.
The dwarfs said, “If you wish, you may live here with us.” Snow White said, “Oh, I could? Thank you.” Then Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story and Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.</a>

"Oh no!" She said. 
"What?" I asked her. 
"I can't find my keys! Where are my keys?" She yelled. 
My mother looked very worried. She thought she had lost her keys, and she was worried that  my dad might get angry. She started running around the house, looking for her keys. 
"Mom!" I said. 
"Not now!" She said, running around the house. "I need to find the keys!"
"Uh, Mom!" I said again. 
"What!?" She stopped and look at me with an angry face. 
"Your keys are in your hand!" I said.
My mother looked in her hand, and there they were. She was holding they keys the whole time. My mother looked very embarrassed, and my sister and I couldn't stop laughing.</a>

Can I help you to read this book for you?" She stared at me, smiled, and said, "Hi. My name is Sarah. Sure, I'd love to. Thanks. What is your name?" "My name is Mia. Ok. Let's start reading this. May !?" "Ok, Ma'am", she said happily. That was a story about a princess. She looked amazed. And I was happy. I finished reading it. "And this is the end of the story of the princess." She said, "That's a wonderful story. Can I borrow this book and others?" "Of course. You can borrow all the books here," I said. "Would you please come to my house tomorrow? My mom will be happy to meet you, Ma'am." I said, "Thanks. I'd like to."​</a>

                            10. Menurut kalian, apa moral dri cerita ini? 
Once upon a time, there lived a little girl named Snow White. She lived with her Aunt and Uncle because her parents were dead.
One day she heard her Uncle and Aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.
Snow White did not want her Uncle and Aunt to do this so she decided it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away from home when her Aunt and Uncle were having breakfast. She ran away into the woods.
She was very tired and hungry.
Then she saw this little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. They went inside. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs. The dwarfs said, “What s your name?” “I am Snow Said,” she said.
The dwarfs said, “If you wish, you may live here with us.” Snow White said, “Oh, I could? Thank you.” Then Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story and Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.</h2><br />
