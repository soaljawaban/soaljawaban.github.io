Incidentally, we used same dress code color that is yellow.At 8 a.m we arrived at the zoo.

I took some pictures with some animals. There were tiger, lion, and bear for the wild animals. Another cage also provide some birds, elephants, and monkeys.Beside those animals, we can see elephant show like a circus performance. The facilitation looked so complete and comfortable, they are restaurant, pool side, fountain, garden etc. We can go around the zoo by using mini train. Because of tiredness, my mother felt so hungry. She wants to buy some foods and beverages at the restaurant with my brother. Then I took a decision to look for my grandmother and my father sitting under the tree.On the way to meet them under the tree. I forgot ask my mother where they had been sitting. The trees looked similar in my eyes. Yet I tried to find them. Luckily I could see them under mahogany. On that day I did not bring my spectacles. I called them screamingly. “Dad, grandma!” They still keep silent. I looked them wear yellow dress. I walked up them to call them once again. “Dad, what are you doing?” “I am calling you just now!” they just got surprised. “Sorry little girl I am not your father.” When I saw them clearly, they were not my father and grandmother. They were couple of husband and wife with yellow dress too. What an embarrasing day at that time. (twist)Artinya :Di dalam perjalanan mencari mereka di bawah pohon.

                        Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very inquisitive. <br />We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles. He blew his whistle now and then. <br />Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at once, "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle, not a drum?" <br />Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly, "Because he is not Phil Collins!" <br /><br />1.  What does the text talk about........<br />A.   Willy and his new drum.<br />B.     Phil Collins and his drum.<br />C.     A policeman and his whistle.<br />D.     Willy's drum private teacher.<br />E.     The writer's five-year old son. <br /><br />2. From the text above we know that Willy is a/n........ boy. <br />A.   smart<br />B.    funny<br />C.    stupid<br />D.    childish<br />E.    annoying<br /> <br />3. Which sentence makes the text a funny story ........ <br />A.      He is very inquisitive.<br />B.      "Because he is not Phil Collins".<br />C.      He blew his whistle now and then.<br />D.      He also likes asking me everything he wants to know.<br />E.       "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle not a drum?"<br /><br />semoga membantu ^_^<br /><br />

                        Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

<br />

Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at
once, "Dad, why is the policeman using a whistle, not a drum?"

<br />

Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly,
"Because he is not Phil Collins!"

                        SMS Spoofing occurs when a sender manipulates address information. Often it is done in order to impersonate a user that has roamed onto a foreign network and is submitting messages to the home network. Frequently, these messages are addressed to destinations outside the home network – with the home SMSC essentially being “hijacked” to send messages into other networks.The impact of this activity is threefold:The home network can incur termination charges caused by the delivery of these messages to interconnect partners.These messages can be of concern to interconnect partners. Their customers may complain about being spammed, or the content of the messages may be politically sensitive. Interconnect partners may threaten to cut off the home network unless a remedy is implemented. Home subscribers will be unable to send messages into these networks.While fraudsters normally used spoofed-identities to send messages, there is a risk that these identities may match those of real home subscribers. The risk therefore emerges, that genuine subscribers may be billed for roaming messages they did not send. If this situation occurs, the integrity of the home operator’s billing process may be compromised, with potentially huge impact on the brand.<br />

                        The Blonde and the Lawyer

A blonde and a lawyer are seated next to each other on a flight from LA to NY.
The lawyer asks if she would like to play a fun game.
The blonde, tired, just wants to take a nap, politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.
The lawyer persists and explains that the game is easy and a lot of fun.
He explains, "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5.00, and vise versa."
Again, she declines and tries to get some sleep. The lawyer, now agitated, says, "Okay, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5.00, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $500.00."
This catches the blonde's attention and, figuring there will be no end to this torment unless she plays, agrees to the game. The lawyer asks the first question. "What's the distance from the earth to the moon?" The blonde doesn't say a word, reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5.00 bill and hands it to the lawyer. "Okay" says the lawyer, "your turn."
She asks the lawyer, "What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four legs?" The lawyer, puzzled, takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references, no answer. He taps into the air phone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress, no answer. Frustrated, he sends e-mails to all his friends and coworkers, to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the blonde, and hands her $500.00.
The blonde says, "Thank you", and turns back to get some more sleep.
The lawyer, who is more than a little miffed, wakes the blonde and asks, "Well, what's the answer?" Without a word, the blonde reaches into her purse, hands the lawyer $5.00, and goes back to sleep.

                        My Favourite Movie<br /><br />My favorite movie is “Monters, Inc.” It is my favorite because it’s funny, the characters are colorful and it has a good story.<br /><br />“Monsters, inc.” characters are Sully, Mike, Boo, and Randall. Sully is like King Kong or gorilla. He is fat, blue and has a lot of fur. He has big teeth. Mike is Sully’s friend. They work together. Mike is small, green and has tiny hands and feet. Most important he has one big eye. Boo is a human, not a monster. She gets into the Monster city by accident.<br /><br />Boo is about two years old. She’s short, cute with black hair in pony tails. Finnaly, theres is Randall. He is the bad guy (villain). He looks just like a lizard. He can also disappear. In the movie Sully and Mike are roommates and work together in an energy company. Their job is to scare the kids. Screaming makes energy to run the city. Sully went into Boo’s room and Boo excaped into Monsterr City. That was a problem becuas monsters think humans are poison. Sully and Mike try to hide Boo because they don’t want to get in trouble. The two friends try to protect her and send her back home.<br /><br />This movie made me feel happy. I was laughing the whole. For example, when baby Boo laughed and giggled, I laughed. Also, when Boo cried, the monster Mike made her laugh by umping and pulling on his eye. Another thing that happened and that when Sully put her down, she would run away and hide. The thing that made me happiest is after all her troubles she finally got back home. There were so many things that were funny I laughed all the time.<br /><br />good luck <br />
