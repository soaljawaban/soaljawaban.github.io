                        <strong>My Vacation in Bali</strong> When I was 3nd grade of junior high school, my friends and I trip to 
Bali for vacation. We were there for five days. We got many precious 
experiences during the vacation.
First day, we visited Kuta Beach in the morning. We saw the lovely 
sunrise there. It was an outstanding view. Then, we checked in to the 
hotel at the night. After taking a nap at the hotel, we went to Tanah 
Lot. Tanah lot was nice place. It was lovely place for taking photo. We 
saw so many tourists there.
 
Second day, we spent our time on Tanjung Benoa beach. We played water
 sports at there. We drove banana boat and speed boat. In the afternoon,
 We went to Penyu island to see unique animals such as big turtles, 
snake, and sea birds. We felt enjoyed and happy.<br />
The last day, we went to Sangeh. We could enjoy the shady forest. There 
were so many monkeys. Sometimes the monkey could be naughty. We could be
 really close with them. After that, we visited to Sukowati Market. I 
bought Bali T-Shirt, souvenirs and some food for gift there
At the night, we had to check out from the our hotel. We went back home and bring so many unforgettable memories of Bali.<br />OrientationMy
 friends and I decided to visit Bali on our school holiday last month. 
There were a lot of places to see in there. Because we never went to 
Bali before, we joined the tours to see as much as possible. My friends 
and I stayed in one of hotel in Kuta on arrival.Sequence of eventsIn
 Kuta beach, we spent our two days by surfing and swimming. Fikri, one 
of my friends tried to sunbathe as if he were a foreigner. We really 
enjoyed our time there. On the next day, we were ready to visit the 
other place listed by the tour guide. the first place we visited was 
SIngaraja. Singaraja is a city of about 95 thousands people. It is a 
busy city but quiet town. The street are lined with trees adn ther are a
 lot of old Dutch houses. We learnt about history of SIngaraja there. 
Then we returned very late to the hotel. We went to bed to regain our 
stamina.<strong>Advertisement</strong> Our
 last tour destination was Ubud. There were a lot of art and craft in 
Ubud. The first stop was at Batu bulan, a center of stone sclupture. We 
watched young boys were carving away at big block of stone. The next 
place we visited was Celuk, a center for silversmiths and goldensmiths. 
After that, we had a lunch at Sukawati and continued touring to Mass, a 
tourist center. We bought some souvenirs in there.Re-orientationOur
 holiday ended very quickly. Beside visiting some places, all our days 
were spent on the beach. We went sailing or surfboarding every day. We 
really enjoyed our holiday in Bali.<br /><br />

                        One day, when I was seven years old, my   mom bought a new bike for my birthday present. I asked my mom to teach me to ride it. Firstly, mommy refused my request and promised that he would teach me soon, exactly next week, when holiday is coming.<br />And the next week are come. He began to teach me riding a bike around the field in my village. My mom was very patient gave me some direction. I was thrilled when I realized my ability to ride on my bike. "Yes I can".<br />Someday, when I'm alone at home, I intend to try my first riding ability. So, I tried to dare. All ran smoothly at first, but when I'm going back to my house and I had to pass through a narrow slippery roads, I was nervous. I lost my control and I fell into a ditch.<br />Afterwards, I told my parents about the accident. I imagine my mom would be angry and never let me go up again. But the reality is exactly the opposite, my mom was very proud of me. He just gave me some advice and since the accident, I got permission to ride my own bike.<br />

                        Camping at Mount Ciremai<br /><br />Last weekend, my friends and I went camping in the mountain Ciremai. We 
reached the camping ground as we walked for about a half hour from the 
parking lot. We built the camp next to the rocks and trees. It was 
getting dark and cold enveloped us, so we built a bonfire. <br /><br />   
The next day, we spent our time observing plantation and insects while 
the girls were preparing food for lunch together. In the afternoon we 
went to the river and catch a fish for dinner. At night, we held a 
bonfire night. We sing, dance, read poetry, comedy, having fun, playing 
magic tricks, and even some of us do stand up comedy and highly 
entertaining us all to laugh. On Monday, we packed our bags and got 
ready to go home, respectively.<br /><br />translate<br /><strong>Berkemah di Gunung </strong><strong>Ciremai</strong><br /><br />    Akhir pekan lalu, teman-teman saya dan saya pergi berkemah di gunung Ciremai.

Hari mulai gelap dan dingin menyelimuti kami, jadi kami membangun api unggun.<br /><br />    Keesokan harinya, kami menghabiskan waktu kita mengamati tanaman dan serangga sementara gadis-gadis sedang menyiapkan makanan untuk makan siang bersama. Di sore hari kami pergi ke sungai dan menangkap ikan untuk makan malam. Pada malam hari, kami mengadakan malam api unggun. Kami bernyanyi, menari, membaca puisi, komedi, bersenang-senang, bermain trik sulap, dan bahkan beberapa dari kita berdiri komedi dan sangat menghibur kita semua tertawa.

Last week my friend and I were bored after three weeks of holidays, so 
we rode our bikes to Pasir Kencana Beach, which is only five kilometres 
from where I live. When we arrived at the beach, we were surprised to 
see there was hardly anyone there.<br /><br />After having a quick dip in 
the ocean, which was really cold, we realized one reason there were not 
many people there. It was also quite windy. After we bought some hot 
chips at the takeaway store nearby, we rode our bikes down the beach for
 a while, on the hard, damp part of the sand. We had the wind behind us 
and, before we knew it, we were many miles down the beach.<br /><br />Before
 we made the long trip back, we decided to paddle our feet in the water 
for a while, and then sit down for a rest. While we were sitting on the 
beach, just chatting, it suddenly dawned on us that all the way back, we
 would be riding into the strong wind.<br /><br />When we finally made it back home, we were both totally exhausted! But we learned some good lessons that day.

There are three major sanctuaries, the Brahmana, Syiwa and Wisnu sanctuaries. They are truly stunning. We went by just Brahmana and Syiwa sanctuaries, on the grounds that Wisnu sanctuary is being remodeled. On Saturday morning we went to Yogya Kraton. We spent around two hours there. We were fortunate on the grounds that we were driven by a brilliant and amicable aide. At that point we proceeded with our adventure to Borobudur.

                        Holiday in Bandung<br />My friends and I went to Bandung last month. They were Jezi, Kayla, Gisel, Pevita, and Diandra. We rent a jeep car with a very high cost because we didn’t plan it long before the day. It could be called as unexpected plan. But, it’s okay. We still determined to go by that car.<br />Our first plan was to visit tourism places in Bandung, such as Kawah Putih and Patenggang. However, Kawah Putih was very crowded. So many people visited it. Then we decided to cancel to visit Kawah Putih. Then, we directly went to Situ Patenggang. When we almost arrived there, we could see a very beautiful lake. We were so excited to see it closer. Whtengen we arrived right at our destination, the situation was quite crowded and full of merchants. We immediately came to lake Situ Patenggang. Wow, it was very beautiful. Unfortunately, there were some trashes around the lake. Whether it was lack of management or the visitor who littered was the cause of that condition. I didn’t know. I only hoped that the management officer of this place and all of the visitors could maintain the cleanness of this beauty of nature which has been created by God.<br />

                        <p> Watching Movie<br /><br />My sister and I went to see a film last night. It was an American movie called The Lost Flight. It showed how people can quickly change when they have to look after themselves in the jungle. It was an interesting film about a plane which crashed on a small empty island in the Pacific Ocean.<br />Although the passengers were safe, nobody knew where the plane had crashed. So the passengers had to learn how to hunt for food in the jungle and how to catch fish from the sea to eat. After a few weeks, the passengers were eating raw fish and meat.<br />After they had been on the island for two months, three of the men made a boat and sailed away to find help. But their boat sank and they were drowned.<br />The film ended without saying whether the passengers were rescued or not. But my sister and I enjoyed the film.<br /></p><p>Semoga bisa membantu<br /></p><br />

                        One day, when I was seven years old, my   mom bought a new bike for my birthday present. I asked my mom to teach me to ride it. Firstly, mommy refused my request and promised that he would teach me soon, exactly next week, when holiday is coming.<br />And the next week are come. He began to teach me riding a bike around the field in my village. My mom was very patient gave me some direction. I was thrilled when I realized my ability to ride on my bike. "Yes I can".<br />Someday, when I'm alone at home, I intend to try my first riding ability. So, I tried to dare. All ran smoothly at first, but when I'm going back to my house and I had to pass through a narrow slippery roads, I was nervous. I lost my control and I fell into a ditch.<br />Afterwards, I told my parents about the accident. I imagine my mom would be angry and never let me go up again. But the reality is exactly the opposite, my mom was very proud of me. He just gave me some advice and since the accident, I got permission to ride my own bike.<br />

                        Watching Movie<br /><br />My sister and I went to see a film last night. It<br />was an American movie called The Lost Flight. It<br />showed how people can quickly change when they<br />have to look after themselves in the jungle. It<br />was an interesting film about a plane which<br />crashed on a small empty island in the Pacific<br />Ocean.<br />Although the passengers were safe, nobody knew<br />where the plane had crashed. So the passengers<br />had to learn how to hunt for food in the jungle<br />and how to catch fish from the sea to eat.<br />After a few weeks, the passengers were eating<br />raw fish and meat.<br />After they had been on the island for two<br />months, three of the men made a boat and sailed<br />away to find help. But their boat sank and they<br />were drowned.<br />The film ended without saying whether the<br />passengers were rescued or not. But my sister<br />and I enjoyed the film.<br />
