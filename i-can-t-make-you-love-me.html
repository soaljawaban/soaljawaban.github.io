I would like to introduce myself. I am Putu Jaya Wijaya. You can call me Jaya or only one letter J. Yeah, that's a very short name but very meaningful since it represents me. I was bom on January 23 2007 in Bandung so I am 14 years old now. I live at Pattimura Street Number X, with my parents and two siblings (one older brother and one younger sister). So, I am the second child in my family. The school subjects that I love are Maths and Saence They are so challenging but also fun. I love reading Science Fiction books because they are very imaginative. They are full of innovative and creative ideas. Science Fiction movies such as interstellar Avatar, Star Wars are the movies I enjoy watching because they are so awesome. Besides, I love travelling, listening to music, and playing games. I usually play games with my siblings and sometimes with my parents. We have so much fun.

            “Once upon a time a hawk feel in love with a hen. The hawk flew down from the sky and asked the hen, “Won,t you marry me?” 
            The hen loved the brave, strong hawk and wishes to marry him.But she said,”I cannot fly as high as you can. If you give me time, I may learn to fly as high as you. Then, we can fly together.”
            The hawk agreed. Before he went away, he gave the hen a ring. “This is to show that you have promised to marry me,”said the hawk.
            So it happened that the hen had already promised to marry a rooster. So, when the rooster saw the ring, he became very angry. “Throw that ring away at once! Didn,t you tell the hawk that you,d already promised to marry me?” shouted the rooster .The hen was so frightened at the rooster anger that she threw away  the ring immediately.
            When the hawk came the next day, the hen told him the truth. The hawk was so furious that he cursed the hen. “Why didn,t you tell me earlier? Now, You,ll always be scratching the earth, and I,ll always be flying above you to catch your children,”said the hawk.
            The curse seems to have come true.

            “Once upon a time a hawk feel in love with a hen. The hawk flew down from the sky and asked the hen, “Won,t you marry me?” 
            The hen loved the brave, strong hawk and wishes to marry him.But she said,”I cannot fly as high as you can. If you give me time, I may learn to fly as high as you. Then, we can fly together.”
            The hawk agreed. Before he went away, he gave the hen a ring. “This is to show that you have promised to marry me,”said the hawk.
            So it happened that the hen had already promised to marry a rooster. So, when the rooster saw the ring, he became very angry. “Throw that ring away at once! Didn,t you tell the hawk that you,d already promised to marry me?” shouted the rooster .The hen was so frightened at the rooster anger that she threw away  the ring immediately.
            When the hawk came the next day, the hen told him the truth. The hawk was so furious that he cursed the hen. “Why didn,t you tell me earlier? Now, You,ll always be scratching the earth, and I,ll always be flying above you to catch your children,”said the hawk.
            The curse seems to have come true.
