                                            *How It All Began*Nearly four thousand years ago, in the Sumerian town of Ur in the valley of the river Euphrates, lived a young man named Abraham. The people of Ur had once worshipped Allah but as time passed they forgot the true religion and started praying to idols, statues made of wood or clay and sometimes even of precious stones. Even as a small child Abraham could not understand how his people, and especially his father, could make these images with their own hands, call them gods, and then worship them. He had always refused to join his people when they paid respect to these statues. Instead he would leave the town and sit alone, thinking about the heavens and the world about him. He was sure his people were doing wrong and so alone he searched for the right way. One clear night as he sat staring at the sky he saw a beautiful shining star, so beautiful that he cried out: „This must be Allah!' He looked at it in awe for some time, until suddenly it began to fade and then it disappeared. He turned away in disappointment saying: I love not things that set. (Qur'an 6.77) On another night Abraham was again looking at the sky and he saw the rising moon, so big and bright that he felt he could almost touch it. He thought to himself: This is my Lord. (Qur'an 6.78) But it was not long before the moon set as well. Then he said, Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of the folk who are astray. (Qur'an 6.78) Abraham then saw the beauty and splendor of the sunrise and decided that the sun must be the biggest and most powerful thing in the universe. But for the third time he was wrong, for the sun set at the end of the day. It was then that he realized that Allah is the Most Powerful, the Creator of the stars, the moon, the sun, the earth and of all living things. Suddenly he felt himself totally at peace, because he knew that he had found the Truth. When he said unto his father and his folk: What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted to them. He said: Do they hear you when you cry? Or do they benefit or harm you? They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting in this manner. He said: See now that which you worship, You and your forefathers! Lo! they are (all) an enemy to me, except the Lord of the Worlds. Who created me, and He guides me, And Who feeds me and waters me. And when I sicken, then He heals me. And Who causes me to die, then gives me lift (again) And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of judgement. (Qur'an 26.70-82) One day, while all the townspeople were out, Abraham angrily smashed all the idols with his right hand except for one which was very large. When the people returned they were furious. They remembered the things Abraham had said about the idols. They had him brought forth before everyone and demanded, 'Is it you who did this to our gods, 0 Abraham?' Abraham replied, But this their chief did it. Ask them, if they are able to speak.' The people exclaimed, 'You know they do not speak.' 'Do you worship what you yourselves have carved when Allah created you and what you make?' Abraham continued, 'Do you worship instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you?' (Qur'an 37.95-6)(Qur'an 21.66) Finally, Abraham warned them, Serve Allah, and keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if you did but know. You serve instead of Allah only idols, and you only invent a lie. Lo! those whom you serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, (for) unto Him you will be brought back.(Qur'an 29. 16-17) The people of Ur decided to give Abraham the worst punishment they could find: he was to be burnt to death. On the chosen day all the people gathered in the centre of the city and even the King of Ur was there. Abraham was then placed inside a special building filled with wood. The wood was lit. Soon the fire became so strong that the people were pushed back by the flames. But Allah said: “O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham”.

                                            Bad Shopping Experience A few weeks ago, I came with my friend Bobby to go shopping in a supermarket. On our way back home, I felt something strange about the motorcycle. Bobby told me that we were out of gasoline. I was terrified because we had no more money left in our pocket at all. We had spent all the money for shopping and our home was still about 5 kilometres away. We had no choice but to push the motorcycle all way home. When we were pushing our motorcycle hopelessly, suddenly a man on a motorcycle asked us what was happening. We briefly told him about our problem. Surprisingly, he gave us some money to buy some gasoline. After giving us the money, he went. I couldn’t say how happy we were. We pushed our motorcycle quickly to the nearby gas station. Thanks to the stranger, we didn’t have to push our motorcycle all the way home anymore. 1. What is the main idea of the text above? 2. Where did the event take place? 3. What was wrong with the motorcycle? 4. Why was he terrified? 5. What did they do after meeting the stranger?​</a>

She was born in 1820 to a wealthyEnglish family. She decided in her teens to become anurse, even though her parents disapproved. At the time,most nurses were from poor families and had little or notrainning. But Nightingale was determined to have herway. In 1850 and 1851, she received training at hospitalsin Egypt and Germany.In 1853, Nightingale took charge of a hospital inLondon, England. Here she showed skills as a nurseand an organizer. She had bells put beside patients'beds. When patients needed a nurse, they rang theirbells. Nobody had thought of this idea before.Nightingale devoted the rest of her long life toimproving public health and educating people aboutthe importance of good hygiene. Britain's hospitalsaccepted her ideas, and they became cleaner andhealthier places.In 1860, Nightingale set up a training school fornurses in London. The "Nightingale nurses," as itsgraduates were called, helped spread Nightingale'sideas around the world Nightingale died in 1910 atthe age of 90.43.

I studied at school on the average level not being a perfect pupil though trying not to be the last as well. From all of the subjects most of all I liked mathematics, biology, and geography. I like mathematics because it is connected with the logic to me. I enjoy logical games and everything connected to that. I like biology because it gives us insight into the world of creation of everything living on the Earth. It seems amazing and unknown, thus worth to be discovered. I like geography simply because I like to discover different cultures. I would not say that I am a devoted traveler as I mainly enjoy sitting in the comfort of my home. Though, I like to discover something new. Hopefully, nowadays we can travel virtually taking amazing 360-degree tours using smartphones or computers and thus “traveling” everywhere we want from the comfort of the sofa.… ​</a>

(Bobot 10) Bad Shopping Experience A few weeks ago, I came with my friend Bobby to go shopping in a supermarket. On our way back home, I felt something strange about the motorcycle. Bobby told me that we were out of gasoline. I was terrified because we had no more money left in our pocket at all. We had spent all the money for shopping and our home was still about 5 kilometres away. We had no choice but to push the motorcycle all way home. When we were pushing our motorcycle hopelessly, suddenly a man on a motorcycle asked us what was happening. We briefly told him about our problem. Surprisingly, he gave us some money to buy some gasoline. After giving us the money, he went. I couldn't say how happy we were. We pushed our motorcycle quickly to the nearby gas station. Thanks to the stranger, we didn't have to push our motorcycle all the way home anymore. 1. What is the main idea of the text above? 2. Where did the event take place? 3. What was wrong with the motorcycle? 4. Why was he terrified? 5. What did they do after meeting the stranger?​</a>

                                            Look in detail at this extract from lines 8 to 18 of the Source: The wind came in gusts, at times shaking the coach as it travelled round the bend of the road, and in the exposed places on the high ground it blew with such force that the whole body of the coach trembled and swayed, rocking between the high wheels like a drunken man. The driver, muffled in a greatcoat to his ears, bent almost double in his seat in a faint attempt to gain shelter from his own shoulders, while the dispirited horses plodded sullenly to his command, too broken by the wind and the rain to feel the whip that now and again cracked above their heads, while it swung between the numb fingers of the driver. The wheels of the coach creaked and groaned as they sank into the ruts on the road, and sometimes they flung up the soft spattered mud against the windows, where it mingled with the constant driving rain, and whatever view there might have been of the countryside was hopelessly obscured.

Tidak mungkin ad di bhs ingg) <br />- will repair (itu artinya bakalan di perbaiki tapi jawabannya tidak tepat dengan soal) <br />- shoulder be stopped (shoulder itu dalam bhs ingg bahu jadi tidak mungkin) <br /><br />Jadi menurut aku yg lebih tepat untuk melengkapi teks tersebut <br />=C.

                            10. *How It All Began*Nearly four thousand years ago, in the Sumerian town of Ur in the valley of the river Euphrates, lived a young man named Abraham. The people of Ur had once worshipped Allah but as time passed they forgot the true religion and started praying to idols, statues made of wood or clay and sometimes even of precious stones. Even as a small child Abraham could not understand how his people, and especially his father, could make these images with their own hands, call them gods, and then worship them. He had always refused to join his people when they paid respect to these statues. Instead he would leave the town and sit alone, thinking about the heavens and the world about him. He was sure his people were doing wrong and so alone he searched for the right way. One clear night as he sat staring at the sky he saw a beautiful shining star, so beautiful that he cried out: „This must be Allah!' He looked at it in awe for some time, until suddenly it began to fade and then it disappeared. He turned away in disappointment saying: I love not things that set. (Qur'an 6.77) On another night Abraham was again looking at the sky and he saw the rising moon, so big and bright that he felt he could almost touch it. He thought to himself: This is my Lord. (Qur'an 6.78) But it was not long before the moon set as well. Then he said, Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of the folk who are astray. (Qur'an 6.78) Abraham then saw the beauty and splendor of the sunrise and decided that the sun must be the biggest and most powerful thing in the universe. But for the third time he was wrong, for the sun set at the end of the day. It was then that he realized that Allah is the Most Powerful, the Creator of the stars, the moon, the sun, the earth and of all living things. Suddenly he felt himself totally at peace, because he knew that he had found the Truth. When he said unto his father and his folk: What do you worship? They said: We worship idols, and are ever devoted to them. He said: Do they hear you when you cry? Or do they benefit or harm you? They said: Nay, but we found our fathers acting in this manner. He said: See now that which you worship, You and your forefathers! Lo! they are (all) an enemy to me, except the Lord of the Worlds. Who created me, and He guides me, And Who feeds me and waters me. And when I sicken, then He heals me. And Who causes me to die, then gives me lift (again) And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of judgement. (Qur'an 26.70-82) One day, while all the townspeople were out, Abraham angrily smashed all the idols with his right hand except for one which was very large. When the people returned they were furious. They remembered the things Abraham had said about the idols. They had him brought forth before everyone and demanded, 'Is it you who did this to our gods, 0 Abraham?' Abraham replied, But this their chief did it. Ask them, if they are able to speak.' The people exclaimed, 'You know they do not speak.' 'Do you worship what you yourselves have carved when Allah created you and what you make?' Abraham continued, 'Do you worship instead of Allah that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you?' (Qur'an 37.95-6)(Qur'an 21.66) Finally, Abraham warned them, Serve Allah, and keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if you did but know. You serve instead of Allah only idols, and you only invent a lie. Lo! those whom you serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, (for) unto Him you will be brought back.(Qur'an 29. 16-17) The people of Ur decided to give Abraham the worst punishment they could find: he was to be burnt to death. On the chosen day all the people gathered in the centre of the city and even the King of Ur was there. Abraham was then placed inside a special building filled with wood. The wood was lit. Soon the fire became so strong that the people were pushed back by the flames. But Allah said: “O fire, be coolness and peace for Abraham”.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Bagaimana semua ini dimulai*</p><p></p><p> Hampir empat ribu tahun yang lalu, di kota Ur Sumeria di lembah sungai Efrat, hiduplah seorang pemuda bernama Abraham.  Orang-orang Ur pernah menyembah Allah tetapi seiring berjalannya waktu mereka melupakan agama yang benar dan mulai berdoa kepada berhala, patung yang terbuat dari kayu atau tanah liat dan terkadang bahkan dari batu mulia.  Bahkan sebagai anak kecil Abraham tidak dapat memahami bagaimana bangsanya, dan terutama ayahnya, dapat membuat patung-patung ini dengan tangan mereka sendiri, menyebut mereka dewa, dan kemudian menyembah mereka.  Dia selalu menolak untuk bergabung dengan orang-orangnya ketika mereka menghormati patung-patung ini.  Sebaliknya dia akan meninggalkan kota dan duduk sendirian, memikirkan tentang langit dan dunia tentang dia.  Dia yakin rakyatnya melakukan kesalahan dan sendirian dia mencari jalan yang benar.  Suatu malam yang cerah ketika dia duduk menatap langit, dia melihat bintang yang bersinar indah, begitu indah sehingga dia berteriak: 'Ini pasti Allah!'  Dia melihatnya dengan kagum selama beberapa waktu, sampai tiba-tiba itu mulai memudar dan kemudian menghilang.  Dia berpaling dengan kecewa sambil berkata: Saya tidak suka hal-hal yang diatur.  (Al-Qur'an 6.77)</p><p></p><p> Pada malam yang lain Abraham melihat lagi ke langit dan dia melihat bulan yang terbit, begitu besar dan terang sehingga dia merasa hampir bisa menyentuhnya.  Dia berpikir sendiri: Inilah Tuhanku.  (Qur'an 6.78) Tapi itu tidak lama sebelum bulan terbenam juga.  Kemudian dia berkata, Kecuali Tuhanku membimbingku, aku pasti akan menjadi salah satu orang yang tersesat.  (Qur'an 6.78) Ibrahim kemudian melihat keindahan dan kemegahan matahari terbit dan memutuskan bahwa matahari pasti yang terbesar dan terkuat di alam semesta.  Tapi untuk ketiga kalinya dia salah, karena matahari terbenam di penghujung hari.  Saat itulah dia menyadari bahwa Allah Maha Kuasa, Pencipta bintang, bulan, matahari, bumi dan semua makhluk hidup.  Tiba-tiba dia merasa dirinya benar-benar damai, karena dia tahu bahwa dia telah menemukan Kebenaran.</p><p></p><p> Ketika dia berkata kepada ayahnya dan bangsanya: Apa yang kamu sembah?  Mereka berkata: Kami menyembah berhala, dan selalu setia kepada mereka.  Dia berkata: Apakah mereka mendengarmu saat kamu menangis?  Atau apakah mereka menguntungkan atau merugikan Anda?  Mereka berkata: Tidak, tapi kami menemukan ayah kami bertindak dengan cara ini.</p><p></p><p> Dia berkata: Lihatlah sekarang apa yang kamu sembah, Kamu dan nenek moyangmu!  Lo!  mereka (semua) adalah musuh saya, kecuali Penguasa Dunia.  Yang menciptakan aku, dan Dia membimbingku, Dan Yang memberi makan dan menyiramiku.  Dan ketika saya sakit, maka Dia menyembuhkan saya.  Dan Siapa yang menyebabkan aku mati, kemudian memberiku tumpangan (lagi) Dan Yang, aku sangat berharap, akan mengampuni dosaku pada hari penghakiman.  (Al-Qur'an 26.70-82)</p><p></p><p> Suatu hari, ketika semua penduduk kota sedang keluar, Abraham dengan marah menghancurkan semua berhala dengan tangan kanannya kecuali yang sangat besar.  Ketika orang-orang kembali, mereka sangat marah.</p><p></p><p> Mereka mengingat hal-hal yang Abraham katakan tentang berhala.  Mereka menyuruhnya tampil di hadapan semua orang dan bertanya, 'Apakah kamu yang melakukan ini pada dewa kami, 0 Abraham?'  Abraham menjawab, Tapi ini kepala mereka yang melakukannya.  Tanyakan kepada mereka, apakah mereka dapat berbicara. '  Orang-orang berseru, 'Kamu tahu mereka tidak berbicara.'  'Apakah kamu menyembah apa yang kamu sendiri telah ukir ketika Allah menciptakan kamu dan apa yang kamu buat?'  Abraham melanjutkan, 'Apakah kamu menyembah selain Allah yang tidak menguntungkan kamu sama sekali, atau merugikan kamu?'  (Al-Qur'an 37,95-6) (Al-Qur'an 21,66)</p><p></p><p> Akhirnya, Ibrahim memperingatkan mereka, Melayani Allah, dan menjaga kewajibanmu kepada-Nya;  itu lebih baik bagi Anda jika Anda melakukannya tetapi tahu.  Anda melayani bukan Allah hanya berhala, dan Anda hanya menciptakan kebohongan.  Lo!  mereka yang kamu layani selain Allah tidak memiliki bekal untukmu.  Jadi carilah rezeki Anda dari Allah, dan layani Dia, dan bersyukur kepada-Nya, (karena) kepada-Nya Anda akan dibawa kembali. (Qur'an 29. 16-17)</p><p></p><p> Orang-orang Ur memutuskan untuk memberikan Abraham hukuman terburuk yang bisa mereka temukan: dia akan dibakar sampai mati.  Pada hari yang dipilih semua orang berkumpul di pusat kota dan bahkan Raja Ur ada di sana.  Abraham kemudian ditempatkan di dalam gedung khusus yang diisi dengan kayu.  Kayu itu dinyalakan.  Segera api menjadi begitu kuat sehingga orang-orang didorong mundur oleh nyala api.  Tapi Allah berfirman: "Hai api, sejuk dan damai untuk Ibrahim".

On our way back home, I felt something strange about the motorcycle. Bobby told me that we were out of gasoline. I was terrified because we had no more money left in our pocket at all. We had spent all the money for shopping and our home was still about 5 kilometres away. We had no choice but to push the motorcycle all way home. When we were pushing our motorcycle hopelessly, suddenly a man on a motorcycle asked us what was happening. We briefly told him about our problem. Surprisingly, he gave us some money to buy some gasoline. After giving us the money, he went. I couldn’t say how happy we were. We pushed our motorcycle quickly to the nearby gas station. Thanks to the stranger, we didn’t have to push our motorcycle all the way home anymore. 1. What is the main idea of the text above? 2. Where did the event take place? 3.

I like biology because it gives us insight into the world of creation of everything living on the Earth. It seems amazing and unknown, thus worth to be discovered. I like geography simply because I like to discover different cultures. I would not say that I am a devoted traveler as I mainly enjoy sitting in the comfort of my home.

(Bobot 10) Bad Shopping Experience A few weeks ago, I came with my friend Bobby to go shopping in a supermarket. On our way back home, I felt something strange about the motorcycle. Bobby told me that we were out of gasoline. I was terrified because we had no more money left in our pocket at all. We had spent all the money for shopping and our home was still about 5 kilometres away. We had no choice but to push the motorcycle all way home. When we were pushing our motorcycle hopelessly, suddenly a man on a motorcycle asked us what was happening. We briefly told him about our problem. Surprisingly, he gave us some money to buy some gasoline. After giving us the money, he went. I couldn't say how happy we were. We pushed our motorcycle quickly to the nearby gas station. Thanks to the stranger, we didn't have to push our motorcycle all the way home anymore. 1. What is the main idea of the text above? 2. Where did the event take place? 3.

                            40. Look in detail at this extract from lines 8 to 18 of the Source: The wind came in gusts, at times shaking the coach as it travelled round the bend of the road, and in the exposed places on the high ground it blew with such force that the whole body of the coach trembled and swayed, rocking between the high wheels like a drunken man. The driver, muffled in a greatcoat to his ears, bent almost double in his seat in a faint attempt to gain shelter from his own shoulders, while the dispirited horses plodded sullenly to his command, too broken by the wind and the rain to feel the whip that now and again cracked above their heads, while it swung between the numb fingers of the driver. The wheels of the coach creaked and groaned as they sank into the ruts on the road, and sometimes they flung up the soft spattered mud against the windows, where it mingled with the constant driving rain, and whatever view there might have been of the countryside was hopelessly obscured.
