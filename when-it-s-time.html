 I know that I a m running out of time 
I want it all
And I am wishing they “d stop tryna turn me off.
I want it on
And I am walking on a wire
Trying to go higher
Feel s like I am surrounded 
By clown and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all
We came here to run it, run it , run it
We came here to run it , run it
Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day 
Watch this madness , colorful charade 
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I will be flying free
I am disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling , What you gonna say ?
Just like fire

I'm really proud to buy this tablet with my own pocket money. I saved the money for a year and finally my dream came true. I could buy my own tablet. My tablet is very stylish. It is red with a clear screen and free anti-scratch. It's light and quite small, so I take it with me everywhere. I'm always writing messages to friends. It also has a good quality camera. It takes really good photos so my friends like to use my tablet when we do group photos. Besides, it's big enough. It has 64 GB memory card. I do college work on it. I also save many videos of my favorite movies. I often download films onto it and watch them in bed. I play games and listen to music on it as well, of course. My mum says I'm addicted because I'm always on it. I even read things on it at breakfast time. I'm not allowed to at dinner time, though and it made me sad. I have to be polite and talk to people then "Welcome back to real life," my mum says. (adapted from https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/) 32. Why does the writer feel sad on dinner? A. S/he cannot watch her/his movie. B. S/he has to talk to other people. C. S/he cannot use her/his tablet. D. S/he must read many things.​</a>

Lenny Kravitz - We Want Peace - 
Come on people
It's time to get together
It's time for the revolution!
Here is once again in our face
Why haven't we learn from our past
We're at the crossroads of our human race
Why are we kicking our own ass
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We're on the eve of destruction my friends
We are about to go to far
Politicians think that war is the way
But we know that love has the power
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
The solution is simple and fame
There won't be peace if we don't try
In a war there is nothing to gain
When so many people will die
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast

Watch this madness , colorful charade

Just like magic, I will be flying free
I am disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling , What you gonna say ?

                            26. The text is for questions below. My favourite thing has to be my new tablet. It is not an expensive one. It costs only two million rupiahs. I'm really proud to buy this tablet with my own pocket money. I saved the money for a year and finally my dream came true. I could buy my own tablet. My tablet is very stylish. It is red with a clear screen and free anti-scratch. It's light and quite small, so I take it with me everywhere. I'm always writing messages to friends. It also has a good quality camera. It takes really good photos so my friends like to use my tablet when we do group photos. Besides, it's big enough. It has 64 GB memory card. I do college work on it. I also save many videos of my favorite movies. I often download films onto it and watch them in bed. I play games and listen to music on it as well, of course. My mum says I'm addicted because I'm always on it. I even read things on it at breakfast time. I'm not allowed to at dinner time, though and it made me sad. I have to be polite and talk to people then "Welcome back to real life," my mum says. (adapted from https://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/) 32. Why does the writer feel sad on dinner? A. S/he cannot watch her/his movie. B. S/he has to talk to other people. C. S/he cannot use her/his tablet. D. S/he must read many things.​</h2><br />

Lenny Kravitz - We Want Peace - 
Come on people
It's time to get together
It's time for the revolution!
Here is once again in our face
Why haven't we learn from our past
We're at the crossroads of our human race
Why are we kicking our own ass
We want peace

We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We're on the eve of destruction my friends
We are about to go to far
Politicians think that war is the way
But we know that love has the power
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We want peace
We want it yes

There won't be peace if we don't try
In a war there is nothing to gain
When so many people will die
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
We want it yes
We want peace
And We want it fast
