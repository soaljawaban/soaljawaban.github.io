Last week i went to the theatre i had a very good seat. The play was very interesting i did not enjoy it. A young man and a young women were sitting behind me they were talking loudly, i got very angry, i could not hear the actors, i turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily, they did not pay any attention,in the end, i could not bear it, i turned round again, I can't hear a word I said angrily.
It's none of your business! the young man said rudely. this is a private conversation!
